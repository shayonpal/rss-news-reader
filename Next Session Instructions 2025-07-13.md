## Completed Today

### Morning Session (Testing)
- ✅ Tested complete Inoreader OAuth flow with real credentials
- ✅ Verified authentication redirects and callbacks work correctly
- ✅ Confirmed user data loads properly (username: shayon)
- ✅ Verified RSS feeds and articles display after auth (152 articles)
- ✅ Fixed ESLint warnings in auth-guard.tsx and auth-status.tsx
- ✅ Created comprehensive test report documenting findings
- ✅ Tested PWA features (manifest, service worker, offline page)
- ✅ Verified responsive design on mobile viewport

### Latest Session (Health Check System)
- ✅ Designed comprehensive health check architecture
- ✅ Implemented core HealthCheckService for monitoring all components
- ✅ Created health check store with Zustand for state management
- ✅ Built automated scheduler (5-minute intervals with pause/resume)
- ✅ Created full health dashboard UI with visual indicators
- ✅ Implemented alert system with severity levels
- ✅ Added API endpoints (/api/health) for external monitoring
- ✅ Split implementation for client/server environments
- ✅ Updated documentation (README, CHANGELOG, created health-check-system.md)

## Next Priority

### 0. Commit Health Check Implementation (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Commit the health check system
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive health check system

- Core health monitoring service for all system components
- Real-time status dashboard with visual indicators
- Automated checks every 5 minutes with pause/resume
- API endpoint for external monitoring
- Alert system with severity-based notifications
- Separate server/client implementations for proper SSR support"

git push origin main
```

### 1. Review Product Documentation (Your Request)
- Analyze `/docs/product/PRD.md` for complete product requirements
- Review `/docs/product/user-stories.md` for all planned features
- Map user stories to GitHub issues to identify gaps

### 2. GitHub Issues Strategy Analysis
Based on completed authentication work:
- **Issue #7** (US-003: Initial Data Storage) - Ready to start
  - Implement IndexedDB with Dexie.js
  - Create article storage with 500 article limit
  - Implement sync queue for offline actions
  
- **Issue #3** (Testing Infrastructure) - Foundation laid
  - Formalize Puppeteer tests from today's work
  - Set up Vitest for unit tests
  - Configure Playwright for E2E tests

- **New Issues to Create** (based on PRD review):
  - Feed management UI components
  - Article reading interface
  - AI summarization integration
  - Offline sync mechanism

### 3. Epic 2 Planning
After IndexedDB implementation, begin core reading features:
- Feed fetching and parsing
- Article list with virtual scrolling
- Read/unread state management
- Basic filtering and search

## Important Context

### Health Check System Notes
- **Architecture**: Split between client (HealthCheckService) and server (ServerHealthCheck)
- **Monitoring**: Database, APIs, Cache, Auth, Network
- **Dashboard**: Located at `/health` (requires authentication)
- **API**: Public endpoint at `/api/health` for external monitoring
- **Scheduler**: Automatic checks every 5 minutes, pauses when app hidden

### Key Decisions Made
- Authentication system is production-ready
- PWA setup is complete and functional
- Service worker only runs in production (by design)
- Mock data can be used for development without API calls
- Health monitoring provides comprehensive system status

### Current Application State
- OAuth flow: ✅ Complete
- User profile: ✅ Loading correctly
- Feed list: ✅ Displays properly
- Article preview: ✅ Basic version working
- Data persistence: ❌ Not implemented (Issue #7)
- Offline support: ⚠️ Service worker ready but no data caching

### Testing Insights
- Inoreader API responds quickly (~270ms for user info)
- Authentication tokens properly stored in httpOnly cookies
- No rate limiting issues during testing
- UI performs well with 150+ articles displayed

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Start next session
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
git pull origin main
npm install  # In case any dependencies changed
npm run dev

# Review product documentation
cat docs/product/PRD.md
cat docs/product/user-stories.md

# Check current GitHub issues
gh issue list --state open

# View project board
gh project list
```

## Files to Review Next Session
1. `/docs/product/PRD.md` - Full product requirements
2. `/docs/product/user-stories.md` - All user stories with acceptance criteria
3. `/docs/development-strategy.md` - GitHub workflow guidelines
4. `/src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Prepared IndexedDB schema (if exists)

## Development Environment Notes
- Next.js 14.2.29 with App Router
- TypeScript configured with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- All auth endpoints working correctly
- Environment variables properly set in .env file

## Remember
- Authentication credentials are working (shayon@agilecode.studio)
- Don't use `find` or `grep` bash commands - use Grep/Glob tools instead
- Run `npm run type-check && npm run lint` before committing
- Update CLAUDE.local.md when implementation status changes
