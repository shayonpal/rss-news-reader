- **[RR-163] Dynamic Sidebar Filtering - Hide feeds/topics based on Read/Unread filter** (Saturday, August 9, 2025 at 11:52 AM)
  - **Core Feature**: Dynamic filtering of sidebar feeds and topics based on Read/Unread filter selection
  - **Tag Interface Extended**: Added `unreadCount` and `totalCount` fields to Tag interface for accurate count tracking
  - **API Enhancement**: Enhanced `/api/tags` endpoint to calculate and return per-user `unread_count` by scoping unread aggregation to user's feeds before joining article_tags
  - **Store Enhancements**: 
    - Modified tag store `loadTags` to get unread counts directly from API
    - Added `applySidebarTags` merge strategy preserving existing tags and updating unread counts
    - Added `updateSelectedTagUnreadCount` for optimistic updates after mark-as-read operations
  - **Filtering Logic**: 
    - **"Unread Only"**: Shows tags with unread articles OR all tags with articles when system has unread but tag counts are 0 (fallback for sync issues)
    - **"Read Only"**: Shows tags that have articles but no unread articles  
    - **"All Articles"**: Shows all tags with articles, dims those with no unread
  - **State Preservation**: Extended RR-27 state preservation to include `tagId` for maintaining tag context when navigating back from article detail
  - **Optimistic Updates**: Integrated optimistic unread count updates in both single and batch mark-as-read flows for immediate UI feedback
  - **Fallback Logic**: Smart fallback that shows total article counts when system has unread articles but tag counts are 0 (handles data sync edge cases)
  - **Data Flow**: Tags now load from database with unread counts immediately (no sync required), with sync providing real-time updates
  - **Files Updated**: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/lib/stores/tag-store.ts`, `src/app/api/tags/route.ts`, `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx`, `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts`

## [0.12.1] - Saturday, August 9, 2025 at 7:09 AM

### Fixed
- **[RR-170] HTML Entity Rendering in Tag Names - Completed** (Saturday, August 9, 2025 at 7:09 AM)
  - **Problem**: Tags with HTML entities like "India&#x2F;Canada" were displaying encoded entities instead of "India/Canada"
  - **Root Cause**: The escapeHtml function was over-escaping forward slashes and other characters that React already handles
  - **Solution**: Removed escapeHtml function and kept only decodeHtmlEntities since React provides automatic XSS protection for text content
  - **Files Changed**: simple-feed-sidebar.tsx (line 285), article-detail.tsx (line 469)

  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into sync pipeline at `/src/app/api/sync/route.ts`
  - **Module**: Comprehensive decoder at `/src/lib/utils/html-decoder.ts` with full TypeScript types
  - **Impact**: Resolved display issues where article titles showed raw HTML entities like "Biden&rsquo;s decision" instead of "Biden's decision"

  - **Problem**: Fixed Fetch Success Rate monitor showing ~1% success rate due to auto-fetch operations being counted as failures
  - **Root Cause**: Auto-fetch operations from RR-148 fetch HTML content (expected) but were being counted as JSON API failures in health metrics
  - **Solution**: Modified `/api/health/parsing` endpoint to exclude `fetch_type='auto'` from success rate calculations
  - **Monitoring Impact**: Uptime Kuma now shows accurate service health instead of false "service down" alerts
  - **Transparency**: Auto-fetch operations still logged and reported separately for debugging purposes
  - **Response Format**: Added explanatory note "Success rate excludes auto-fetch operations (content parsing)"
  - **Result**: Health status changed from "unhealthy" (1% success) to "healthy" (100% success)
  - **Files Updated**: `/src/app/api/health/parsing/route.ts` with filtered fetch statistics
