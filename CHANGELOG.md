### Fixed

- **[RR-216] Filter State Preservation During Back Navigation with Race Condition Protection** (Saturday, August 16, 2025 at 3:20 AM)
  - **Problem**: Filter state lost when navigating back from article detail view, causing users to lose their filtering context
  - **Root Cause**: Race condition between URL parameter restoration and API request handling causing premature filter clearing
  - **Two-Layer Solution**: 
    - **Gating Layer**: `filtersReady` guard prevents article rendering until filter state fully restored from URL parameters
    - **Request Sequencing**: `loadSeq` counter ensures only latest API requests update the UI, preventing stale data overwrites
  - **Symbol-Level Implementation**:
    - `src/app/page.tsx`: Enhanced `handleFeedSelect` and `handleTagSelect` functions with URL parameter management for filter persistence
    - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx`: Added `filtersReady` guard to `ArticleList` component preventing premature rendering
    - `src/hooks/use-article-list-state.ts`: Implemented `restoreStateIfAvailable` function with RR-216-specific filter matching logic
    - `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts`: Added `loadSeq` counter for race condition prevention with request sequencing
    - `src/lib/utils/article-list-state-manager.ts`: Enhanced filter state coordination between URL parameters and store state
  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with RR-27 article preservation feature, maintaining both filter context and read article visibility
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with 13 test files (unit, integration, E2E) validating filter preservation, race condition handling, and navigation flows
  - **Impact**: Users now maintain their filter context (feed/tag selections) when navigating back from articles, eliminating need to re-apply filters repeatedly
  - **Linear Reference**: RR-216

### Fixed

- **Fixed React hydration errors on iPhone Safari**
  - **Root cause**: Client-side only code running during SSR, causing UI mismatch between server and client
  - **Primary issue**: `useViewport` hook accessing `window.innerWidth` during initial state, causing different values on server (1024px) vs iPhone (375px)
  - **Secondary issues**:
    - iOS detection using `navigator.userAgent` during render in HomePage and ArticleDetail components
    - Dark mode detection using `document.documentElement.classList` during render in MorphingDropdown component
    - Missing `suppressHydrationWarning` on relative timestamp in ArticleDetail

### UI/UX – Liquid Glass follow‑ups

- Article detail view now uses a headerless, floating control scheme
  - Circular glass back button + clustered glass action toolbar (icon+label on desktop, icon‑only on mobile)
  - Toolbar is constrained to article content width and is safe‑area aware in PWA
  - Added collapse behavior: the entire right cluster (including the trigger) disappears when the menu opens, showing only the dropdown content
  - Restyled dropdown as a glass popover (18px radius, blur, widened min‑width, subtle separators, improved item spacing)
  - Replaced More label with an ellipsis icon
- Action labels and consistency
  - Detail labels: Star/Unstar, Summarize/Re‑summarize, Full Content/Original Content
  - List cards: actions are icon‑only for tighter density
- PWA spacing helpers
  - Introduced `.top-safe-48` (48px + safe area) and applied to floating controls for reliable tap targets across devices

### Fixed

- **[RR-176] Critical Auto-Parse Regression and Button Synchronization Fix**
  - Fixed critical bug where ALL articles triggered auto-parse instead of only partial feeds (94% reduction in unnecessary API calls)
  - Corrected field reference bug: `feed.isPartialFeed` (never populated) → `feed.isPartialContent` (properly maintained)
  - Consolidated database schema: removed confusing dual fields, now single `is_partial_content` field
  - Fixed fetch/revert content buttons that showed visual changes but didn't actually work
  - Enhanced button state synchronization - removed duplicate bottom button, unified state management
  - Implemented force-original content revert that bypasses stored full content to show RSS original
  - Added toast notifications for user feedback (amber loading, green success, red error)
  - Only 5/66 feeds now correctly marked as partial (Forbes, BBC, AppleInsider, Ars Technica, Cult of Mac)
- **[RR-5] Accurate Inoreader API Usage in Sidebar**
  - Source of truth: capture `X-Reader-Zone{1,2}-{Usage,Limit}` and `X-Reader-Limits-Reset-After` from every Inoreader response (reads and writes)
  - Persist only header-provided values; removed hardcoded defaults and legacy count overwrites
  - Expose `/api/sync/api-usage` with 30s cache; Zone 1 `used = max(header_usage, daily_call_count)` to mitigate header lag; Zone 2 uses header totals
  - Updated `/api/sync/last-sync` to prefer DB (`sync_metadata` → `sync_status`) before falling back to log file
  - Sidebar now reflects real-time usage and correct last sync time after manual/auto sync

### UI/UX – Liquid Glass adoption (iOS 26-inspired)

- Implemented clear liquid-glass navigation panes with scroll-aware contrast
  - Top headers: `src/components/layout/header.tsx`, article list header via `src/app/page.tsx`, and article detail header `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx`
  - Tokens and utilities added to `src/app/globals.css` (`--glass-blur`, `--glass-nav-bg`, `--glass-nav-bg-scrolled`, `.glass-nav`)
- Converted article detail footer to a floating glass toolbar with slide-away-on-scroll behavior
  - Added `.glass-footer` styles; footer now mirrors header motion and contrast
- Unified floating “Scroll to top” button with Liquid Glass tokens for consistent blur/tint
- Replaced read-status dropdown with a glass segmented pill (3 options: All, Unread, Read)
  - Icon-only on mobile, icon+label on desktop; sliding indicator; accessible roles
  - New styles: `.glass-segment`, `.glass-segment-3`, `.glass-segment-indicator`, `.glass-segment-btn`
  - Changed Unread icon to `MailOpen` for clearer semantics
- Sidebar improvements
  - Added fixed, glass-styled bottom info bar showing last sync and API usage
    - Content scrolls behind it; supports safe‑area insets; tuned mobile spacing/left padding
  - Removed duplicate “feeds total” from the bottom section (already shown in header)

### Changed

- Tuned glass to be clearer/less frosty across themes (reduced blur/tint, softer shadows)
- Removed counts under the main header title (information already available elsewhere)
- Back button aligned to content width on desktop; increased top offset for better spacing
- Article detail footer spacing refined for readability

### Fixed

- Corrected selected-pill alignment on desktop by switching to grid-based indicator sizing
- Addressed compact pill touch targets to meet 44px minimum while keeping header fit
- Ensured header and footer glass panes deepen slightly on scroll for legibility
