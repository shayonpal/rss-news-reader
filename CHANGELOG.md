- **[RR-5] Accurate Inoreader API Usage in Sidebar**
  - Source of truth: capture `X-Reader-Zone{1,2}-{Usage,Limit}` and `X-Reader-Limits-Reset-After` from every Inoreader response (reads and writes)
  - Persist only header-provided values; removed hardcoded defaults and legacy count overwrites
  - Expose `/api/sync/api-usage` with 30s cache; Zone 1 `used = max(header_usage, daily_call_count)` to mitigate header lag; Zone 2 uses header totals
  - Updated `/api/sync/last-sync` to prefer DB (`sync_metadata` → `sync_status`) before falling back to log file
  - Sidebar now reflects real-time usage and correct last sync time after manual/auto sync

### UI/UX – Liquid Glass adoption (iOS 26-inspired)

- Implemented clear liquid-glass navigation panes with scroll-aware contrast

  - Changed Unread icon to `MailOpen` for clearer semantics
- Sidebar improvements
  - Added fixed, glass-styled bottom info bar showing last sync and API usage
    - Content scrolls behind it; supports safe‑area insets; tuned mobile spacing/left padding
  - Removed duplicate “feeds total” from the bottom section (already shown in header)

### Changed

- Tuned glass to be clearer/less frosty across themes (reduced blur/tint, softer shadows)
- Removed counts under the main header title (information already available elsewhere)
- Back button aligned to content width on desktop; increased top offset for better spacing
- Article detail footer spacing refined for readability

### Fixed

- Corrected selected-pill alignment on desktop by switching to grid-based indicator sizing
