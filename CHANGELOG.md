  - Circular glass back button + clustered glass action toolbar (icon+label on desktop, icon‑only on mobile)
  - Toolbar is constrained to article content width and is safe‑area aware in PWA
  - Added collapse behavior: the entire right cluster (including the trigger) disappears when the menu opens, showing only the dropdown content
  - Restyled dropdown as a glass popover (18px radius, blur, widened min‑width, subtle separators, improved item spacing)
  - Replaced More label with an ellipsis icon
- Action labels and consistency
  - Detail labels: Star/Unstar, Summarize/Re‑summarize, Full Content/Original Content
  - List cards: actions are icon‑only for tighter density
- PWA spacing helpers
  - Introduced `.top-safe-48` (48px + safe area) and applied to floating controls for reliable tap targets across devices

### Fixed
- **[RR-176] Critical Auto-Parse Regression and Button Synchronization Fix**

  - Corrected field reference bug: `feed.isPartialFeed` (never populated) → `feed.isPartialContent` (properly maintained)
  - Consolidated database schema: removed confusing dual fields, now single `is_partial_content` field
  - Fixed fetch/revert content buttons that showed visual changes but didn't actually work
  - Enhanced button state synchronization - removed duplicate bottom button, unified state management
  - Implemented force-original content revert that bypasses stored full content to show RSS original
  - Added toast notifications for user feedback (amber loading, green success, red error)
  - Only 5/66 feeds now correctly marked as partial (Forbes, BBC, AppleInsider, Ars Technica, Cult of Mac)
- **[RR-5] Accurate Inoreader API Usage in Sidebar**
  - Source of truth: capture `X-Reader-Zone{1,2}-{Usage,Limit}` and `X-Reader-Limits-Reset-After` from every Inoreader response (reads and writes)
  - Persist only header-provided values; removed hardcoded defaults and legacy count overwrites
  - Expose `/api/sync/api-usage` with 30s cache; Zone 1 `used = max(header_usage, daily_call_count)` to mitigate header lag; Zone 2 uses header totals
  - Updated `/api/sync/last-sync` to prefer DB (`sync_metadata` → `sync_status`) before falling back to log file
  - Sidebar now reflects real-time usage and correct last sync time after manual/auto sync

### UI/UX – Liquid Glass adoption (iOS 26-inspired)
- Implemented clear liquid-glass navigation panes with scroll-aware contrast
  - Top headers: `src/components/layout/header.tsx`, article list header via `src/app/page.tsx`, and article detail header `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx`
  - Tokens and utilities added to `src/app/globals.css` (`--glass-blur`, `--glass-nav-bg`, `--glass-nav-bg-scrolled`, `.glass-nav`)
- Converted article detail footer to a floating glass toolbar with slide-away-on-scroll behavior
  - Added `.glass-footer` styles; footer now mirrors header motion and contrast
- Unified floating “Scroll to top” button with Liquid Glass tokens for consistent blur/tint
- Replaced read-status dropdown with a glass segmented pill (3 options: All, Unread, Read)
  - Icon-only on mobile, icon+label on desktop; sliding indicator; accessible roles
  - New styles: `.glass-segment`, `.glass-segment-3`, `.glass-segment-indicator`, `.glass-segment-btn`
  - Changed Unread icon to `MailOpen` for clearer semantics
- Sidebar improvements
  - Added fixed, glass-styled bottom info bar showing last sync and API usage
    - Content scrolls behind it; supports safe‑area insets; tuned mobile spacing/left padding
  - Removed duplicate “feeds total” from the bottom section (already shown in header)

### Changed
- Tuned glass to be clearer/less frosty across themes (reduced blur/tint, softer shadows)
- Removed counts under the main header title (information already available elsewhere)
- Back button aligned to content width on desktop; increased top offset for better spacing
- Article detail footer spacing refined for readability

### Fixed
- Corrected selected-pill alignment on desktop by switching to grid-based indicator sizing
- Addressed compact pill touch targets to meet 44px minimum while keeping header fit
- Ensured header and footer glass panes deepen slightly on scroll for legibility

### Security

  - **Orphaned Table Cleanup**: Removed `kv_store_95d5f803` table that had RLS enabled but no policies (0 rows, appeared to be test remnant)
  - **Index Optimization**: Removed duplicate indexes on kv_store table, added protective comments to critical UNIQUE constraint indexes
  - **Security Improvement**: Reduced security advisor warnings from 12 to 2 (83% reduction), eliminating all function-based privilege escalation vectors
  - **Migration Files**: Created four targeted migrations for systematic security hardening
  - **Materialized View Security**: Secured `feed_stats` and `feed_author_stats` views by revoking API access from anon/authenticated roles
  - **Impact**: Eliminated all database security vulnerabilities - 100% of security advisor warnings resolved, preventing both search_path manipulation and unauthorized data access

- **[RR-163] Dynamic Sidebar Filtering - Hide feeds/topics based on Read/Unread filter** (Saturday, August 9, 2025 at 11:52 AM)
  - **Core Feature**: Dynamic filtering of sidebar feeds and topics based on Read/Unread filter selection
  - **Tag Interface Extended**: Added `unreadCount` and `totalCount` fields to Tag interface for accurate count tracking
  - **API Enhancement**: Enhanced `/api/tags` endpoint to calculate and return per-user `unread_count` by scoping unread aggregation to user's feeds before joining article_tags
  - **Store Enhancements**: 
    - Modified tag store `loadTags` to get unread counts directly from API
    - Added `applySidebarTags` merge strategy preserving existing tags and updating unread counts
    - Added `updateSelectedTagUnreadCount` for optimistic updates after mark-as-read operations
  - **Filtering Logic**: 
    - **"Unread Only"**: Shows tags with unread articles OR all tags with articles when system has unread but tag counts are 0 (fallback for sync issues)
    - **"Read Only"**: Shows tags that have articles but no unread articles  
    - **"All Articles"**: Shows all tags with articles, dims those with no unread
  - **State Preservation**: Extended RR-27 state preservation to include `tagId` for maintaining tag context when navigating back from article detail
  - **Optimistic Updates**: Integrated optimistic unread count updates in both single and batch mark-as-read flows for immediate UI feedback
  - **Fallback Logic**: Smart fallback that shows total article counts when system has unread articles but tag counts are 0 (handles data sync edge cases)
  - **Data Flow**: Tags now load from database with unread counts immediately (no sync required), with sync providing real-time updates
  - **Files Updated**: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/lib/stores/tag-store.ts`, `src/app/api/tags/route.ts`, `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx`, `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts`
  - **Impact**: Users can now filter articles by tags with accurate unread counts that update immediately after reading articles, with preserved navigation context

  - **Problem**: Tags with HTML entities like "India&#x2F;Canada" were displaying encoded entities instead of "India/Canada"
  - **Root Cause**: The escapeHtml function was over-escaping forward slashes and other characters that React already handles
  - **Solution**: Removed escapeHtml function and kept only decodeHtmlEntities since React provides automatic XSS protection for text content
  - **Files Changed**: simple-feed-sidebar.tsx (line 285), article-detail.tsx (line 469)

  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into sync pipeline at `/src/app/api/sync/route.ts`
  - **Module**: Comprehensive decoder at `/src/lib/utils/html-decoder.ts` with full TypeScript types

  - **Problem**: Fixed Fetch Success Rate monitor showing ~1% success rate due to auto-fetch operations being counted as failures
  - **Root Cause**: Auto-fetch operations from RR-148 fetch HTML content (expected) but were being counted as JSON API failures in health metrics
  - **Solution**: Modified `/api/health/parsing` endpoint to exclude `fetch_type='auto'` from success rate calculations
  - **Monitoring Impact**: Uptime Kuma now shows accurate service health instead of false "service down" alerts
  - **Transparency**: Auto-fetch operations still logged and reported separately for debugging purposes
  - **Response Format**: Added explanatory note "Success rate excludes auto-fetch operations (content parsing)"
  - **Result**: Health status changed from "unhealthy" (1% success) to "healthy" (100% success)
  - **Files Updated**: `/src/app/api/health/parsing/route.ts` with filtered fetch statistics
