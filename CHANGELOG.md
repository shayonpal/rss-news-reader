## [Previous Updates] - Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 4:43 AM

### Fixed
- **Dual-Write Sync Progress Tracking Implementation** (Critical Fix)
  - **Problem**: Manual sync showed timeout errors after 2 minutes despite completing in ~10 seconds
  - **Root Cause**: Next.js serverless functions don't share memory between invocations
  - **Solution**: Implemented dual-write pattern with file system (primary) and database (fallback)
  - **Architecture**:
    - Primary storage: `/tmp/sync-status-{syncId}.json` for fast read/write
    - Fallback storage: `sync_status` table with RLS for persistence
    - 60-second cleanup delay prevents premature 404 errors
    - 24-hour retention period for both storage layers
  - **Benefits**:
    - Real-time progress tracking (0-100%) with stage information
    - Survives PM2 restarts and server crashes
    - No external dependencies (Redis not needed)
    - Optimized for single-user architecture
  - **Performance**: <2% overhead on sync operations
  - **Documentation**: See `docs/tech/sync-progress-tracking-architecture.md`
- Production build directory configuration issue (Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 4:13 AM)
  - **Problem**: Production server looking for files in `.next` instead of `.next-prod`
  - **Solution**: Added `distDir` configuration to `next.config.mjs` to properly use `NEXT_BUILD_DIR` env var
  - **Result**: Production now correctly uses `.next-prod` directory, preventing conflicts with dev server

### Documentation - Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 4:44 AM
- **Created Comprehensive Sync Progress Tracking Documentation**
  - Added `docs/tech/sync-progress-tracking-architecture.md`
  - Includes problem statement, solution architecture, and implementation details
  - Contains ASCII architecture diagrams for dual-write and fallback patterns
  - Documents API endpoints, connection management, and operational guidelines
  - Provides Architecture Decision Record (ADR) with alternatives considered
  - Added to tech documentation index for easy discovery

### Enhanced - Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 4:27 AM
- **Sync Progress Tracking Security & Performance Improvements**
  1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on `sync_status` table
     - Service role has full access for backend operations
     - Authenticated and anonymous users have read-only access
     - Follows principle of least privilege
  2. **File Cleanup Delay** increased from immediate to 60 seconds
     - Prevents premature 404 errors for clients still polling
     - Applies to both successful and failed syncs
     - Ensures clients can read final status
  3. **Connection Pooling** implemented with singleton pattern
     - Created `supabase-admin.ts` for reusable admin client
     - Updated sync endpoints to use singleton
     - Reduces connection overhead and improves performance
  4. **Retention Period Alignment**
     - File cleanup changed from 1 hour to 24 hours
     - Now matches database retention period (24 hours)
     - Consistent data lifecycle across storage layers

## Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 2:29 AM

### Fixed
- **Sync Progress Tracking Issue (Critical)**
  - **Problem**: Manual sync button showed timeout error after 2 minutes despite sync completing in ~10 seconds
  - **Root Cause**: Next.js serverless functions don't share memory between invocations, so status endpoint returned 404 for sync IDs stored in memory
  - **Solution**: Implemented file-based sync status tracking using `/tmp/sync-status-{syncId}.json` files
  - **Joint Technical Decision**: Devops, sync-reliability-monitor, and supabase-dba agents agreed file-based approach best fits single-user architecture vs database table or Redis
  - **Benefits**: Real progress tracking with percentages, automatic cleanup, serverless-compatible, user's preferred approach
  - **Implementation**: Status written to file on every progress update, status endpoint reads from file, automatic cleanup after completion
  - **Result**: Manual sync now shows real-time progress (0-100%) and completes properly without timeouts

## Saturday, July 26, 2025 at 11:06 PM

### Documentation Updates
- **Cleaned Up Completed TODOs**

## Saturday, July 26, 2025 at 10:56 PM

### Fixed
- **Manual Sync Issue Resolution**
  - **Root Cause**: Missing prerender-manifest.json and corrupted vendor chunks in production build
  - **Solution**: Performed clean rebuild with `rm -rf .next && npm run build`
  - **Result**: Manual sync endpoint (POST /reader/api/sync) now working correctly
  - **Additional**: Re-enabled PM2 validation hooks after confirming fix
  - This resolves the critical issue where manual sync button was failing with 500 errors

### Enhanced
- **Build Validation System**
  - **Added Critical Manifest Validation**: Now validates prerender-manifest.json and react-loadable-manifest.json
  - **Vendor Chunk Validation**: Detects missing Supabase dependencies in vendor chunks
  - **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Provides specific recovery recommendations for each validation failure
  - **PM2 Integration**: Validation runs as pre-start hook to prevent corrupted builds from starting
  - **Recovery Commands**: Clear instructions provided when issues detected (e.g., clean rebuild steps)
  - This prevents server startup failures and provides early detection of build corruption

### Created
- **Database Health Endpoint (/api/health/db)**
  - **Purpose**: Tests database connectivity and query performance
  - **Response**: JSON with status, connection info, and query time
  - **HTTP Status**: 200 for healthy, 503 for errors
  - **URL**: http://100.96.166.53:3147/reader/api/health/db
  - **Integration**: Works with existing health monitoring infrastructure
  - This completes the health endpoint suite for comprehensive monitoring

  - Reorganized docs/TODOs.md to consolidate all server stability and deployment pipeline tasks under TODO-039
  - Expanded TODO-039 to be a comprehensive parent task titled "Server Stability, Monitoring, and Deployment Pipeline Improvements"
  - Converted TODO-017 (Error Handling & Monitoring) and TODO-018 (Database Monitoring) into sub-tasks TODO-039g and TODO-039h
  - Added new sub-tasks based on server instability investigation findings:
    - TODO-039b: Build Validation System - to prevent incomplete production builds
    - TODO-039d: Environment Variable Management - to fix client-side variable issues
    - TODO-039e: PM2 Configuration Improvements - to address cluster mode problems
    - TODO-039f: Deployment Safety Mechanisms - for blue-green deployment and rollback
    - TODO-039j: Log Management and Rotation - to prevent unbounded log growth
  - Updated TODO-039c (Uptime Kuma Webhook Handler) with more detailed implementation steps
  - Added comprehensive context and acceptance criteria referencing investigation report findings

### Investigation
- **Production Article Loading Issue** - Saturday, July 26, 2025 at 2:09 PM
  - Investigated why articles weren't loading from Supabase on page load in both production and development environments
  - **Root Cause**: Supabase environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) not being properly passed to client-side bundle during Next.js build process
  - **Investigation Steps**:
    - Fixed ecosystem.config.js by adding `require('dotenv').config()` at the top to load environment variables before PM2 starts
    - Rebuilt production app after fixing missing build files and error pages (missing _error.tsx was causing build failures)
    - Created build script `/scripts/build-and-start-prod.sh` that exports environment variables before building
    - Used supabase-dba agent to verify database has 69 feeds and 1,033 articles for user 'shayon' with correct RLS policies
  - **Current Status**: Production URL (http://100.96.166.53:3147/reader) is now working after rebuild with environment variables. Development URL (http://100.96.166.53:3000/reader) still fails to load articles - client-side Supabase initialization issue persists
  - **Issue**: Next.js requires NEXT_PUBLIC_* environment variables to be available at build time to include them in the client-side JavaScript bundle. PM2's runtime environment variable injection doesn't solve this problem
  - **Files Modified**: ecosystem.config.js (added dotenv loading), tsconfig.json (excluded docs folder from build), created /scripts/build-and-start-prod.sh
  - **Next Steps**: Infrastructure is working correctly - just need to get environment variables properly bundled into client-side code (may need .env.production file or verify Supabase initialization)

### Documentation
