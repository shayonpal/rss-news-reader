## Important Context

- **App Status**: All features implemented but sync blocked by rate limit
- **Issue #22**: Implementation complete, pending verification
- **Testing URL**: https://d2c0493e4ec2.ngrok-free.app (NEVER use localhost)

## Commands to Run Next Session

```bash
# Continue development
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
git status

# First, verify Issue #22 (after rate limit reset)
open https://d2c0493e4ec2.ngrok-free.app
