## Commands to Run Next Session

```bash
# Continue debugging the UI issue
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
git status

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test in browser (data is already synced!)
open https://d2c0493e4ec2.ngrok-free.app/reader

# Debug React error - focus on SimpleFeedSidebar first
# Check browser console for "Objects are not valid as a React child"

# Once UI fixed, close Issue #25
gh issue close 25 --comment "Authentication and sync fully working - 69 feeds, 100 articles synced successfully"

# Move to next Epic 2 issue
gh issue list --label epic-2-reading --state open
```

## ðŸ”§ Debug Commands for UI Issue

```bash
# Check Zustand store data for objects
# In browser console:
# console.log(useFeedStore.getState())
# Look for objects where strings expected

# Test components in isolation:
# Comment out sections of SimpleFeedSidebar
# Binary search to isolate the problematic rendering
```
