## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION

### Fix Supabase Schema for Issue #39
**Problem**: Legacy recovery fails because 'preferences' column is missing from users table
**Solution**: Add the column to Supabase schema
**Time Required**: 5 minutes

#### Steps to Fix:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rgfxyraamghqnechkppg
2. Navigate to Table Editor ‚Üí users table
3. Add new column:
   - Name: `preferences`
   - Type: `jsonb`
   - Default: `{}`
   - Nullable: Yes
4. Save changes

#### After Fix:
1. Test recovery again using test page at https://strong-stunning-worm.ngrok-free.app/test-recovery
2. Verify data migrates to Supabase successfully
3. Close Issue #39

## Key Findings from Testing

### Issue #39 Implementation Status:
- ‚úÖ **UI Implementation**: Beautiful recovery dialog with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ **Database Discovery**: Successfully finds legacy databases
- ‚úÖ **Data Extraction**: Correctly counts articles, feeds, folders
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with retry options
- ‚ùå **Migration**: Blocked by missing 'preferences' column

### Sync Discovery:
- Current sync saves to **IndexedDB only**, not Supabase
- This explains why cross-domain persistence isn't working yet
- Need new issue to update sync to use Supabase

### Test Infrastructure Created:
- `/test-recovery` page for testing legacy recovery
- Can create test legacy data and trigger recovery dialog
- Useful for future testing

### SECONDARY: Issue #23 - Read/Unread State Management üìñ
- **Priority**: High - Final Epic 2 story
- **Effort**: Medium (4-6 hours)
- **Details**: Sync read/unread state with Inoreader
- **Dependencies**: None (Issues #20-22 complete)

### TERTIARY: Issue #35 - API Logging Service üìä
- **Priority**: P1 - Will help debug rate limit issues
- **Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
- **Details**: Phase 1 quick implementation for immediate debugging

## Important Context for Next Session

### Critical Information:
- **ngrok Domain**: strong-stunning-worm.ngrok-free.app (permanent reserved domain)
- **Supabase Project ID**: rgfxyraamghqnechkppg
- **Schema Issue**: Missing 'preferences' column in users table (jsonb type needed)
- **Current Architecture**: Hybrid (IndexedDB for local, Supabase for cloud - but sync not connected yet)

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Authentication with 365-day tokens
- ‚úÖ Sync from Inoreader (69 feeds, 50 articles successfully synced)
- ‚úÖ Local storage in IndexedDB
- ‚úÖ Legacy recovery UI (except for schema issue)
- ‚úÖ Supabase connection and operations

### What Needs Work:
- ‚ùå Supabase schema missing 'preferences' column
- ‚ùå Sync only saves to IndexedDB, not Supabase
- ‚ùå Cross-domain data persistence not working yet

### Test Credentials (from .env):
- Inoreader: shayon@agilecode.studio / SakshiChopra!986
- Use these with Playwright MCP for testing

## Commands to Run Next Session

```bash
# Continue development
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
git status

# First, remove the test page (optional)
rm src/app/test-recovery/page.tsx

# After fixing Supabase schema, test Issue #39:
npm run dev

# Test via ngrok URL (update if needed)
ngrok http --domain=strong-stunning-worm.ngrok-free.app 3000

# Navigate to test page
open https://strong-stunning-worm.ngrok-free.app/test-recovery

# Test recovery:
# 1. Create test legacy data
# 2. Clear recovery flag
# 3. Navigate to /reader
# 4. Verify recovery dialog appears
# 5. Test migration to Supabase

# After Issue #39 is working, create new issue for Supabase sync:
gh issue create --title "Update sync to save data to Supabase" \
  --body "Currently sync only saves to IndexedDB. Need to also save to Supabase for cross-domain persistence." \
  --label "enhancement,priority-p1,component-sync"
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Issue #39 (Legacy IndexedDB Data Recovery) - READY TO IMPLEMENT:
- **Data Discovery**: Enumerate all IndexedDB databases for RSS reader data
