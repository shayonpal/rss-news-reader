## Commands to Run Next Session
```bash
# Start development
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
npm run dev:network

# Test current performance (should show improvement)
open http://100.96.166.53:3000/reader/test-performance

# Validate security is still working
node test-rls-security.js

# Check Supabase performance reports
ls -la docs/tech/supabase-advisory/2025-07-21/
```

## Performance Test Results 
### Before Migration (Mobile)
- **Supabase connection:** 315ms
- **Simple query:** 254ms (5 feeds)
- **Count query:** 189ms (287 unread)
- **Feed hierarchy load:** 6.4s

### After Migration (January 22, 2025)
- **New function query:** ~150ms (22 rows - aggregated counts)
- **Old method query:** ~130ms (290 rows - all articles)
- **Data reduction:** 92.4% (290 rows â†’ 22 rows)
- **Network improvement:** Significant reduction in payload size
- **Accuracy:** âœ… Verified - counts match exactly

## Important Reminders
- **âœ… SECURITY COMPLETE:** Database is production-ready with RLS enabled
- **âœ… PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED:** 92.4% data reduction achieved with unread counts function
- **ðŸš€ NEXT FOCUS:** Complete remaining performance analysis (TODO-004) and feature completion
- **Service Role Key:** Keep server-side only, never expose to client
- **Security Testing:** Use `node test-rls-security.js` to validate RLS anytime
- **Documentation:** Master TODO list available at `/docs/TODOs.md`

## Technical Architecture
- **Server:** Handles all external APIs (Inoreader, Claude)
- **Client:** Pure presentation layer, reads from Supabase only
- **Security:** Tailscale network + RLS policies
- **Data Flow:** Inoreader â†’ Server â†’ Supabase â†’ Client
