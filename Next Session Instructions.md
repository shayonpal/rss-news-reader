# Next Session Instructions

**Last Updated:** Tuesday, January 21, 2025 at 4:45 PM

## Latest Session - January 21, 2025 (2:30 PM - 4:45 PM)
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Main focus:** US-203 Server API Integration & US-103 Server API Endpoints
- **Issues worked:** US-203 (partial), US-103 (complete)

## Current State
- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** Clean (all changes pushed)
- **Latest commit:** 9f30998
- **Server endpoints:** All working (sync, content extraction, AI summaries)

## Completed This Session
- âœ… Fixed Next.js basePath routing issue causing 404s
- âœ… Implemented sync functionality with real-time progress
- âœ… Created all server API endpoints (US-103)
- âœ… Added rate limit warnings and tracking
- âœ… Successfully tested sync (168 articles)
- âœ… Updated all documentation

## Next Priority - Epic 3: AI Summarization ðŸ¤–

### 1. **US-301: Claude API Integration** (UI work needed)
Server endpoint exists at `/api/articles/:id/summarize` and is working.
Need to add client-side UI:
- Article list: Show âš¡ indicator for articles with summaries
- Article view: Add "Generate Summary" button
- Display summaries in article cards
- Handle loading states and errors

### 2. **US-302: Summary UI Integration**
- Design summary display component
- Add regeneration option for existing summaries
- Implement 5-second loading timeout UI
- Show token usage/cost if available

### 3. **Complete US-203** (Remaining tasks)
- Add "Fetch Full Content" button to article view
- Display extracted content when available
- These features complement AI summaries

## Important Context
- **Server endpoints ready:** Both content extraction and AI summary endpoints are fully functional
- **Rate limiting:** Inoreader API limited to 100 calls/day (currently tracking usage)
- **Architecture:** Server handles all external APIs, client is presentation only
- **No client auth:** Access controlled by Tailscale network

## Commands to Run Next Session
```bash
# Start development
cd /Users/shayon/DevProjects/rss-news-reader
git pull origin main
npm run dev:network

# View server endpoints documentation
open http://100.96.166.53:3000/reader/test-server-api

# Check current sync status
# The app should have 168 articles already synced
```

## Technical Notes
- Claude API integration uses Claude 4 Sonnet
- Summaries are 150-175 words as configured
- Content extraction uses Mozilla Readability
- All features cache results in Supabase to minimize API calls

## UI Components Needed
1. Summary indicator in article list (âš¡ icon)
2. "Generate Summary" button in article view
3. Summary display card with regenerate option
4. Loading spinner with timeout handling
5. Error state for failed generations
