pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --dry-run

# 4. Create deployment scripts (TODO-035)
mkdir -p scripts
touch scripts/deploy-production.sh
chmod +x scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 5. Test production database connection (TODO-036)
# Use Supabase dashboard or create test script

# 6. After all pre-deployment tasks, build for production
npm run build

# 7. Start production deployment

```

## Important Reminders
- **DO NOT** deploy to production until ALL pre-deployment tasks (TODO-033 to TODO-036) are complete
- **CREATE** the dev branch FIRST before making any changes
- **TEST** the PM2 configuration with --dry-run before actual deployment
- **BACKUP** current PM2 state with `pm2 save` before changes
- **VERIFY** production database has all migrations applied
- **REFERENCE** `/docs/deployment/ci-cd-strategy.md` for detailed steps
- **PORT 3147** is reserved for production to avoid conflicts

## Performance Test Results 
### Before Migration (Mobile)
- **Supabase connection:** 315ms
- **Simple query:** 254ms (5 feeds)
- **Count query:** 189ms (287 unread)
- **Feed hierarchy load:** 6.4s

### After Migration (January 22, 2025)
- **New function query:** ~150ms (22 rows - aggregated counts)
- **Old method query:** ~130ms (290 rows - all articles)
- **Data reduction:** 92.4% (290 rows â†’ 22 rows)
- **Network improvement:** Significant reduction in payload size
- **Accuracy:** âœ… Verified - counts match exactly

## Important Reminders
- **âœ… SECURITY COMPLETE:** Database is production-ready with RLS enabled
- **âœ… PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED:** 92.4% data reduction achieved with unread counts function
- **ðŸš€ NEXT FOCUS:** Complete remaining performance analysis (TODO-004) and feature completion
- **Service Role Key:** Keep server-side only, never expose to client

## Technical Architecture
- **Server:** Handles all external APIs (Inoreader, Claude)
- **Client:** Pure presentation layer, reads from Supabase only
- **Security:** Tailscale network + RLS policies
- **Data Flow:** Inoreader â†’ Server â†’ Supabase â†’ Client
