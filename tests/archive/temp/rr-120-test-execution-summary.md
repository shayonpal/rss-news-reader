# RR-120 Test Execution Summary

## Test Plan Overview

Created comprehensive test files for Linear issue RR-120 health endpoint fixes:

### Issues Being Tested:

1. `/api/health/app` missing `timestamp` field at root level
2. `/api/health/app?ping=true` returns wrong format - should return `{ status: "ok", ping: true }`
3. API 404s return HTML instead of JSON

## Test Files Created

### 1. Unit Tests for Health Route Handler

**File**: `src/__tests__/unit/rr-120-health-route-timestamp.test.ts`

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ‚ùå 11/11 tests failing (as expected)
- **Purpose**: Tests timestamp field inclusion and ping response format
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Root level timestamp field inclusion
  - Ping response format validation
  - Edge cases for query parameter handling
  - Response consistency validation

### 2. Unit Tests for Health Service

**File**: `src/__tests__/unit/rr-120-health-service-timestamp.test.ts`

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ‚ö†Ô∏è Not executed yet
- **Purpose**: Tests health service behavior without timestamp generation
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - SystemHealth structure validation
  - Health status calculation
  - Error handling
  - Static method functionality

### 3. Integration Tests for API 404 JSON Responses

**File**: `src/__tests__/integration/rr-120-api-404-json-responses.test.ts`

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ‚ö†Ô∏è Not executed yet (integration tests excluded from unit test runs)
- **Purpose**: Tests that API routes return JSON 404 responses instead of HTML
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - JSON format requirements for API 404s
  - API vs page route differentiation
  - Security requirements (no sensitive info exposure)
  - Performance and edge cases

### 4. Edge Case Tests for Health Endpoints

**File**: `src/__tests__/edge-cases/rr-120-health-endpoint-edge-cases.test.ts`

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Created, ‚ö†Ô∏è Not executed yet
- **Purpose**: Tests various edge cases and error scenarios
- **Key Test Cases**:
  - Concurrent request handling
  - URL parsing edge cases
  - Error recovery scenarios
  - Memory and performance edge cases
  - Timestamp precision and consistency

## Test Execution Results

### Current Status: RED PHASE ‚úÖ

All tests are designed to FAIL initially to follow TDD methodology. Test execution confirms:

**Unit Test Results** (`rr-120-health-route-timestamp.test.ts`):

- ‚ùå 11/11 tests failed as expected
- Key failures confirm the issues exist:
  - Missing timestamp field in health responses
  - Wrong ping response format (includes timestamp)
  - Incorrect response structure

**Expected Failures**:

```
√ó should include timestamp field at root level in health response
  ‚Üí expected { status: 'healthy', ‚Ä¶(6) } to have property "timestamp"

√ó should return correct ping response format with timestamp
  ‚Üí expected { status: 'ok', ‚Ä¶(1) } to deeply equal { status: 'ok', ping: true }
```

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 1: Fix Health Route Handler

1. Add timestamp generation at route level in `/api/health/route.ts`
2. Fix ping response format to exclude timestamp and include `ping: true`
3. Ensure error responses also include timestamp

### Phase 2: Fix API 404 Handler

1. Create middleware or custom handler for API 404s
2. Implement JSON response format: `{ error: "Not Found", status: 404, path: "/api/..." }`
3. Ensure API routes return JSON while page routes return HTML

### Phase 3: Validation

1. Run all test files to confirm fixes
2. Verify existing functionality isn't broken
3. Confirm acceptance criteria are met

## Test Coverage

The test files provide comprehensive coverage for:

- ‚úÖ Timestamp field requirements
- ‚úÖ Ping response format validation
- ‚úÖ API 404 JSON response handling
- ‚úÖ Edge cases and error scenarios
- ‚úÖ Performance and concurrency testing
- ‚úÖ Security requirements

## Quality Assurance Notes

- All tests follow TDD red-green-refactor methodology
- Tests are isolated and properly mocked
- Edge cases and error scenarios are thoroughly covered
- Tests validate exact requirements from Linear issue RR-120
- Performance and security aspects are included
