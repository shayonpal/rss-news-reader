### The Problem

As a news enthusiast with ADHD, I struggle with:

- **Information overload** from 200+ daily articles
- **Partial feeds** requiring constant context switching

- **Duplicate content** from multiple sources covering the same stories

### The Solution

Shayon's News is a PWA RSS reader that:

- **Saves time** with AI-powered 100-120 word summaries
- **Works offline** with intelligent content caching
- **Reduces friction** with one-tap summary generation
- **Maintains focus** with a clean, Reeder-inspired interface

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Inoreader Integration** - Single source of truth for feed management
2. **AI Summarization** - On-demand summaries using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
3. **Offline Support** - Cache last 50 articles + all viewed content
4. **Full Content Fetching** - Manual fetch for partial feeds
5. **Bidirectional Sync** - Read/unread status syncs with Inoreader

### User Experience
