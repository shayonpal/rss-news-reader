## Notes for Development Team

### Technical Considerations

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Optimize for both iOS and Android PWA experience
- Consider offline-first architecture from the start

### User Testing Recommendations

- Test with primary persona (Shayon) regularly
- Validate AI summary quality with real users
- Performance test on low-end devices
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Offline scenario testing

### Risk Mitigation

- API rate limiting could block development - use mock data extensively
- AI summarization costs could escalate - implement strict usage limits
- Offline sync complexity - start with simple conflict resolution
- Performance on older devices - test early and often

This comprehensive user story document should guide the development team through building a world-class RSS reader that truly serves the needs of efficient news consumers.
