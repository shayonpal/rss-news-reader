# User Stories - Shayon's News RSS Reader PWA

**Created**: January 21, 2025  
**Architecture**: Server-Client Model (Server handles all Inoreader API, Client reads from Supabase)  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This document contains user stories for completing the RSS Reader PWA based on the new server-client architecture. All complex operations (OAuth, sync, content extraction, AI summarization) happen server-side. The client is a pure presentation layer that reads from Supabase and calls server API endpoints.

The document includes 21 user stories organized into 7 epics, with the existing 2 open GitHub issues (#31, #32) incorporated as future enhancements.

**Key Architecture Principles:**
- Server handles ALL Inoreader API communication (4-5 calls per sync)
- Client has NO authentication - access controlled by Tailscale network
- Data flows: Inoreader â†’ Server â†’ Supabase â†’ Client
- Clean-slate migration: No data migration, start fresh with server sync

## Primary Persona

### Shayon
- **Role**: Tech-savvy Product Manager with ADHD
- **Context**: Single user of a self-hosted RSS reader
- **Goals**: Efficient news consumption with AI summaries
- **Access**: Via Tailscale network only (http://100.96.166.53/reader)
- **Values**: Privacy, simplicity, time-efficiency

## Epic 1: Server Foundation ðŸš€

**Goal**: Establish server-side infrastructure for all external API communication

### US-101: Server OAuth Setup âœ…

**As** Shayon  
**I want** the server to handle all Inoreader authentication  
**So that** I never need to authenticate in the client

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] One-time OAuth setup script using Playwright automation
- [x] Uses test credentials from `.env` file
- [x] Runs on Mac Mini with localhost:8080 callback
- [x] Tokens encrypted and stored in `~/.rss-reader/tokens.json`
- [x] File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- [x] Automatic token refresh before expiration
- [x] Clear success/error messages during setup

**Implementation Notes:**
```bash
npm run setup:oauth
# Automated flow:
# 1. Starts Express server on localhost:8080
# 2. Launches Playwright browser
# 3. Auto-fills Inoreader credentials from .env
# 4. Captures tokens from callback
# 5. Stores encrypted tokens
# 6. Note: OAuth callback URL must be http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
```

2. /tag/list             // Get tags  
3. /stream/contents      // Get ALL articles
4. /unread-count         // Get counts
5. /edit-tag             // Update read states (if needed)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

### US-703: Incremental Sync with Date Parameters (Future Consideration)

**As** Shayon  
**I want** to evaluate whether incremental sync using date parameters would improve efficiency  
**So that** I can optimize API usage and performance if needed

**Context:**
The current sync implementation fetches the latest N articles (configured via `SYNC_MAX_ARTICLES`, default 200) and uses database-level deduplication via upsert operations with `onConflict: 'inoreader_id'`. This approach:
- Ensures no duplicates (database unique constraint)
- Updates existing articles with latest read/starred status
- Handles overlapping time ranges elegantly
- Maintains data integrity without complex state management

**Potential Benefits of Date Parameters (`ot`/`nt`):**
- Reduced API payload size (fetch only new articles)
- Lower Supabase write operations
- Faster sync completion times
- More frequent sync capability within rate limits

**Current Approach Advantages:**
- Simplicity (no timestamp tracking needed)
- Always updates read/starred status for recent articles
- No risk of missing articles due to time gaps
- Robust error recovery (no partial state)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Monitor current sync performance and API usage patterns
- [ ] Track scenarios where >200 new articles accumulate between syncs
- [ ] Evaluate if users experience delays with current approach
- [ ] Consider implementation only if:
  - API rate limits become constraining
  - Sync performance degrades with data growth
  - Need for more frequent syncs (hourly vs daily)
  - Supabase costs become significant

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Would require tracking last successful sync timestamp
- Need to handle edge cases (long gaps, time zone issues)
- Continuation tokens for fetching >1000 new articles
- More complex error recovery logic

**Recommendation:** Keep current implementation unless scaling issues arise. The simplicity and reliability of the current approach outweighs the optimization benefits for a single-user application.

**Priority:** P4 - Future Optimization  
**Story Points:** 8 (if implemented)

- [ ] Default prompt template remains in code as fallback
- [ ] Environment variables override default settings:
  - [ ] `CLAUDE_SUMMARY_WORD_COUNT` - Target word count (default: "150-175")
  - [ ] `CLAUDE_SUMMARY_PROMPT` - Full custom prompt template
  - [ ] `CLAUDE_SUMMARY_FOCUS` - Focus areas (e.g., "facts, conclusions, implications")
- [ ] Prompt template supports variable substitution:
  - `{WORD_COUNT}` - From env var or default
  - `{TITLE}`, `{AUTHOR}`, `{DATE}` - Article metadata
  - `{CONTENT}` - Article body
  - `{FOCUS}` - Custom focus areas
- [ ] Changes take effect without code deployment
- [ ] Invalid prompts fall back to default gracefully
- [ ] Document prompt engineering best practices

**Implementation Notes:**
- Store in `.env` file on server
- Hot-reload not required (restart acceptable)
- Consider prompt versioning for A/B testing
- Log which prompt version was used per summary

**Example Configuration:**
```env
CLAUDE_SUMMARY_WORD_COUNT=200-250
CLAUDE_SUMMARY_FOCUS=key facts, main arguments, implications, and author's perspective
CLAUDE_SUMMARY_PROMPT=Summarize this article in {WORD_COUNT} words focusing on {FOCUS}. Article: {TITLE} by {AUTHOR}\n\n{CONTENT}

## Technical Notes

### No Client-Side Complexity
- No OAuth flows
- No API rate limiting
- No token management
- No conflict resolution
- No offline sync logic

### Server Handles Everything
- OAuth tokens
- Inoreader API calls
- Content extraction
- AI summarization
- Rate limiting
- Error recovery

### Clean Architecture
- Server: Node.js + Express + Playwright
- Client: Next.js + Tailwind + Zustand
- Data: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Network: Tailscale
- Deployment: PM2 + Caddy

This simplified architecture dramatically reduces complexity while maintaining all core functionality. The single-user, self-hosted approach allows for these optimizations that wouldn't be possible in a multi-user SaaS product.

## Epic 8: Security & Performance Fixes ðŸ”’

**Goal**: Address critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues identified by Supabase advisors

### US-801: Enable Row Level Security (Critical Security Fix)

**As** Shayon  
**I want** Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all public tables  
**So that** my data is protected from unauthorized access even if someone obtains the Supabase anon key

**Context:**
Supabase advisory (2025-07-21) identified that RLS is disabled on all public tables, creating a major security vulnerability where anyone with the anon key could read/modify data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Enable RLS on all public tables:
  - [ ] `public.users` table
  - [ ] `public.feeds` table
  - [ ] `public.folders` table
  - [ ] `public.articles` table
  - [ ] `public.api_usage` table
  - [ ] `public.sync_metadata` table
- [ ] Create appropriate RLS policies for single-user access:
  - [ ] All operations restricted to the single user (shayon)
  - [ ] Read-only access for anon key (client operations)
  - [ ] Write access through service role only (server operations)
- [ ] Test that client can still read data with RLS enabled
- [ ] Test that unauthorized access is blocked
- [ ] Document the RLS policies in migration file

**Implementation Notes:**
```sql
-- Example RLS policy for single-user setup
ALTER TABLE public.articles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow read access for the single user
CREATE POLICY "Single user can read articles" ON public.articles
  FOR SELECT

### US-802: Fix Function Security Vulnerability

**As** Shayon  
**I want** the database function to have explicit search_path  
**So that** it cannot be exploited for SQL injection attacks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Update `public.update_updated_at_column` function with explicit search_path
- [ ] Set search_path to 'public' only
- [ ] Test that the function still works correctly
- [ ] Create migration to update existing function

**Implementation Notes:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

### US-803: Optimize Database Performance

**As** Shayon  
**I want** optimized database queries and reduced overhead  
**So that** the app performs faster and uses fewer resources

**Context:**
Performance analysis shows timezone queries consuming 45.4% of execution time, schema introspection taking 10.2%, and slow upsert operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Timezone Optimization**:
  - [ ] Investigate why timezone queries are so frequent
  - [ ] Implement caching or alternative approach
  - [ ] Reduce timezone query overhead by >80%
- [ ] **Schema Introspection**:
  - [ ] Identify source of frequent schema queries
  - [ ] Cache schema information if possible
  - [ ] Reduce introspection query frequency
- [ ] **Upsert Optimization**:
  - [ ] Add indexes for upsert conflict columns if missing
  - [ ] Consider batch upsert operations
  - [ ] Optimize article upserts (currently 28-52ms)
  - [ ] Optimize feed upserts (currently 13.7ms)
- [ ] **Additional Optimizations**:
  - [ ] Review and optimize the unread counts function
  - [ ] Add composite indexes for common query patterns
  - [ ] Consider materialized views for complex aggregations

**Performance Targets:**
- [ ] Average query response time < 20ms
- [ ] No single query type consuming > 20% of total time
- [ ] Feed load time < 500ms (down from 6.4s)

**Priority:** P1 - Performance  
**Story Points:** 8

### US-804: Implement Database Monitoring

**As** Shayon  
**I want** ongoing monitoring of database performance and security  
**So that** I can proactively identify and fix issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Set up automated Supabase advisor reports
- [ ] Create alerts for:
  - [ ] Slow queries (> 100ms)
  - [ ] Failed RLS policy checks
  - [ ] High resource usage
- [ ] Document monitoring setup
- [ ] Create runbook for common issues

**Priority:** P2 - Monitoring  
**Story Points:** 3
