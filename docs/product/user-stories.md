# User Stories - Shayon's News RSS Reader PWA

**Created**: January 21, 2025  
**Architecture**: Server-Client Model (Server handles all Inoreader API, Client reads from Supabase)  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This document contains user stories for completing the RSS Reader PWA based on the new server-client architecture. All complex operations (OAuth, sync, content extraction, AI summarization) happen server-side. The client is a pure presentation layer that reads from Supabase and calls server API endpoints.

The document includes 21 user stories organized into 7 epics, with the existing 2 open GitHub issues (#31, #32) incorporated as future enhancements.

**Key Architecture Principles:**
- Server handles ALL Inoreader API communication (4-5 calls per sync)
- Client has NO authentication - access controlled by Tailscale network
- Data flows: Inoreader â†’ Server â†’ Supabase â†’ Client
- Clean-slate migration: No data migration, start fresh with server sync

## Primary Persona

### Shayon
- **Role**: Tech-savvy Product Manager with ADHD
- **Context**: Single user of a self-hosted RSS reader
- **Goals**: Efficient news consumption with AI summaries
- **Access**: Via Tailscale network only (http://100.96.166.53/reader)
- **Values**: Privacy, simplicity, time-efficiency

## Epic 1: Server Foundation ðŸš€

**Goal**: Establish server-side infrastructure for all external API communication

### US-101: Server OAuth Setup âœ…

**As** Shayon  
**I want** the server to handle all Inoreader authentication  
**So that** I never need to authenticate in the client

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] One-time OAuth setup script using Playwright automation
- [x] Uses test credentials from `.env` file
- [x] Runs on Mac Mini with localhost:8080 callback
- [x] Tokens encrypted and stored in `~/.rss-reader/tokens.json`
- [x] File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- [x] Automatic token refresh before expiration
- [x] Clear success/error messages during setup

**Implementation Notes:**
```bash
npm run setup:oauth
# Automated flow:
# 1. Starts Express server on localhost:8080
# 2. Launches Playwright browser
# 3. Auto-fills Inoreader credentials from .env
# 4. Captures tokens from callback
# 5. Stores encrypted tokens
# 6. Note: OAuth callback URL must be http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
```

**Priority:** P0 - Blocker  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** âœ… DONE (2025-01-21)

### US-102: Server Sync Service (Partially Complete)

**As** Shayon  
**I want** the server to automatically sync articles every 24 hours

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Cron job runs daily sync at midnight (future)
- [x] Efficient API usage: 4-5 calls per sync
- [x] Single stream endpoint fetches ALL articles (max 100)
- [ ] Round-robin distribution (max 20 per feed)
- [x] Sync status tracked in memory (MVP)
- [ ] Errors logged to `sync_errors` table (future)
- [x] Token refresh handled automatically
- [ ] Read state changes synced to Inoreader using batch updates (future)

**API Efficiency:**
```typescript
// 4-5 API calls total:
1. /subscription/list     // Get feeds
2. /tag/list             // Get tags  
3. /stream/contents      // Get ALL articles
4. /unread-count         // Get counts
5. /edit-tag             // Update read states (if needed)
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created `/api/sync` endpoint for manual sync
- Created `/api/sync/status/:id` for polling sync progress
- Uses server-side OAuth tokens from `~/.rss-reader/tokens.json`
- Successfully syncs feeds and articles to Supabase
- In-memory sync status tracking (should use Redis in production)
- Manual sync works - automatic cron job deferred to later

**Priority:** P0 - Core Feature  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS - Manual sync working, automatic cron job pending

- [x] All endpoints return proper error codes (429, 500, etc.)
- [x] Rate limiting enforced (100 calls/day)
- [x] Response format consistent across endpoints

**Implementation Notes:**
- Enhanced `/api/sync` with rate limiting and usage tracking
- Created content extraction using Mozilla Readability
- Integrated Claude 4 Sonnet for AI summaries
- Added `api_usage` and `sync_metadata` tables

## Technical Notes

### No Client-Side Complexity
- No OAuth flows
- No API rate limiting
- No token management
- No conflict resolution
- No offline sync logic

### Server Handles Everything
- OAuth tokens
- Inoreader API calls
- Content extraction
- AI summarization
- Rate limiting
- Error recovery

### Clean Architecture
- Server: Node.js + Express + Playwright
- Client: Next.js + Tailwind + Zustand
- Data: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Network: Tailscale
- Deployment: PM2 + Caddy

This simplified architecture dramatically reduces complexity while maintaining all core functionality. The single-user, self-hosted approach allows for these optimizations that wouldn't be possible in a multi-user SaaS product.
