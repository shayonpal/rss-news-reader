# RR-170: HTML Entity Rendering Fix in Tag Names

**Date**: Saturday, August 9, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix / User Experience Improvement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Issue Summary

Tags containing HTML entities like "India&#x2F;Canada" were displaying with raw encoded entities instead of rendering properly as "India/Canada". This affected user experience in both the sidebar navigation and article detail views.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by the `escapeHtml` function being applied after HTML entity decoding, which was:

1. **Over-escaping**: Converting already-safe characters like forward slashes (/) to HTML entities
2. **Redundant**: React already provides automatic XSS protection for text content
3. **Interfering**: Preventing proper display of legitimately decoded HTML entities

## Technical Details

### Problem Code Pattern

```javascript
// Before (problematic)
{
  escapeHtml(decodeHtmlEntities(tag.name));
}
```

### Solution Implementation

```javascript
// After (fixed)
{
  decodeHtmlEntities(tag.name);
}
```

### Files Changed

1. **src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx** (line 285)
   - Removed escapeHtml wrapper from tag name display
   - Kept decodeHtmlEntities to handle entities like &#x2F;

2. **src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx** (line 469)
   - Applied same fix for consistency across components
   - Ensures tag display is uniform throughout the application

## Security Impact

### No Security Regression

The change does **not** introduce security vulnerabilities because:

1. **React Protection**: React automatically escapes text content to prevent XSS
2. **Text Context**: Tag names are displayed as text content, not as HTML
3. **Input Validation**: Tag creation still validates and sanitizes input at the API level
4. **Database Storage**: Tags are stored safely in the database with proper constraints

### XSS Protection Maintained

- React's built-in protection handles XSS prevention for text content
- HTML entity decoding only converts safe entities like &#x2F; to /
- No dangerous HTML elements or scripts can be injected through tag names

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing

- Verified tags with HTML entities now display correctly
- Confirmed no XSS vulnerabilities in tag display
- Tested consistency between sidebar and article detail views

### Examples Tested

- **Before**: "India&#x2F;Canada" displayed as raw entities
- **After**: "India/Canada" displays correctly as intended

## User Impact

### Positive Impact

- ✅ Tags now display with proper formatting
- ✅ Improved readability of tag names with special characters
- ✅ Consistent tag display across all UI components

### No Negative Impact

- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Related Issues

- **RR-154**: HTML entity decoding implementation for article content

## Documentation Updates

- Updated security documentation to reflect new approach
- Modified testing documentation to reference HTML entity decoding
- Updated technical documentation to clarify XSS protection strategy
