# RR-67: Database Security Fixes

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive database security fixes implemented to address SECURITY DEFINER views and missing search_path configurations in critical functions.

**Linear Issue**: RR-67
**Implementation Date**: August 9, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH - Critical security vulnerabilities

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. SECURITY DEFINER Views (4 ERROR-level issues)

Views with SECURITY DEFINER bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies, allowing users to see data they shouldn't have access to. This creates a privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Affected Views**:
- `sync_queue_stats` - Sync monitoring view
- `author_quality_report` - Author coverage analysis  
- `author_statistics` - Author metrics view
- `sync_author_health` - Sync health monitoring

**Risk**: These views executed with the definer's privileges (typically a superuser), bypassing all RLS policies and potentially exposing sensitive data across user boundaries.

### 2. Missing search_path in Functions (7 WARN-level issues)

Functions without explicit search_path are vulnerable to search_path manipulation attacks, where an attacker could create malicious objects in another schema to hijack function execution.

**Affected Functions**:
- `get_unread_counts_by_feed(uuid)` - Core unread count functionality
- `get_articles_optimized(uuid, uuid, boolean, integer, integer)` - Main article fetching
- `refresh_feed_stats()` - Post-sync statistics update
- `add_to_sync_queue(uuid, text, text)` - Bi-directional sync operations
- `update_updated_at_column()` - Timestamp trigger
- `increment_api_usage(*)` - API call tracking (2 overloaded versions)
- `clean_old_sync_queue_entries()` - Queue maintenance

**Risk**: Functions could be manipulated to execute malicious code or access wrong tables through schema hijacking.

## Implementation Details

### Migration File

**Location**: `supabase/migrations/0001_security_fixes_rr67.sql`

The migration is structured in three sections:

#### Section 1: Fix SECURITY DEFINER Views
```sql
-- Drop existing views with SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.sync_queue_stats CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.author_quality_report CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.author_statistics CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.sync_author_health CASCADE;

-- Recreate with explicit SECURITY INVOKER
CREATE VIEW public.sync_queue_stats WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
[view definition]...
```

#### Section 2: Add search_path to Functions
```sql
-- Protect each function with explicit search_path
ALTER FUNCTION public.get_unread_counts_by_feed(uuid) SET search_path = public;
ALTER FUNCTION public.get_articles_optimized(uuid, uuid, boolean, integer, integer) SET search_path = public;
-- ... etc for all 7 functions (8 signatures total)
```

#### Section 3: Validation Queries
The migration includes commented validation queries to verify the fixes were applied correctly.

### Test Implementation

**Test Files**:
- `src/__tests__/contracts/rr-67-security-fixes.contract.ts` - Behavior contracts
- `src/__tests__/unit/rr-67-security-validation.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `src/__tests__/integration/rr-67-security-fixes.test.ts` - Integration tests

**Test Coverage**: 32 unit tests defining exact expected behavior for all security fixes

## Security Improvements

### Before Migration
- **ERROR-level issues**: 4 (SECURITY DEFINER views)
- **WARN-level issues**: 20 (including search_path and others)
- **Total security issues**: 24

### After Migration
- **ERROR-level issues**: 0 âœ…
- **WARN-level issues**: 13
- **Total security issues**: 13
- **Improvement**: 46% reduction in total warnings, 100% elimination of critical issues

## Technical Details

### SECURITY INVOKER vs SECURITY DEFINER

**SECURITY DEFINER** (vulnerable):
- View/function executes with the privileges of the user who created it
- Bypasses RLS policies
- Can lead to privilege escalation

**SECURITY INVOKER** (secure):
- View/function executes with the privileges of the user calling it
- Respects RLS policies
- Follows principle of least privilege

### search_path Protection

**Without search_path** (vulnerable):
```sql
-- Attacker could create malicious objects in user schema
CREATE SCHEMA evil;
CREATE TABLE evil.articles AS SELECT * FROM public.articles;
-- Function might read from evil.articles instead of public.articles
```

**With search_path = public** (secure):
```sql
ALTER FUNCTION get_articles_optimized SET search_path = public;
-- Function always uses public schema, ignoring any hijacking attempts
```

## Rollback Strategy

If issues occur, the migration can be rolled back by:

1. Recreating views with SECURITY DEFINER (not recommended)
2. Removing search_path from functions (not recommended)

However, rollback would reintroduce all security vulnerabilities and should only be considered in extreme cases.

## Validation

### Post-Migration Checks

1. **Verify no SECURITY DEFINER views**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND viewname IN ('sync_queue_stats', 'author_quality_report', 'author_statistics', 'sync_author_health')
AND definition ILIKE '%SECURITY DEFINER%';
-- Expected: 0
```

2. **Verify functions have search_path**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
AND p.proname IN (...)
AND p.proconfig::text LIKE '%search_path=public%';
-- Expected: 8 (7 functions, 1 with 2 overloads)
```

3. **Run Supabase Security Advisor**:
- Should show 0 ERROR-level issues
- Significant reduction in WARN-level issues

## Monitoring

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. **Application Logs**: Check for any RLS-related errors
2. **Query Performance**: Monitor for any performance degradation (< 5% acceptable)
3. **User Access**: Verify users can only see their own data
4. **Sync Operations**: Ensure bi-directional sync continues working

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default Security Settings**: Always use SECURITY INVOKER for views unless SECURITY DEFINER is explicitly required
2. **Function Protection**: All functions should have explicit search_path set
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Run Supabase security advisors regularly
4. **Test-First Approach**: Define security requirements as tests before implementation
