## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase-Based Testing Approach

The test suite is designed to validate each phase of the removal process:

1. **Pre-Removal Validation** - Establish baseline system state
2. **API Route Removal** - Verify route file deletion and 404 responses
3. **Unit Test Cleanup** - Validate test file removal
4. **Integration Test Updates** - Ensure no broken test references
5. **Monitoring Script Updates** - Verify monitoring system updates
6. **Database Cleanup** - Analyze database function usage
7. **Post-Removal Validation** - Comprehensive system health check
8. **Regression Testing** - Ensure no functionality breakage

## Test Scenarios and Coverage

### 1. Pre-Removal Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Establish baseline state before making changes

**Key Test Cases**:

- Verify freshness API currently accessible and functional
- Document all freshness references in codebase (baseline count)
- Validate monitoring scripts include freshness checks
- Confirm database functions exist and work
- Establish service health baseline

**Success Criteria**:

- Freshness endpoint returns valid response (200/503)
- All baseline health endpoints functional
- Monitoring systems operational with freshness included

### 2. During Removal Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Validate each removal phase progresses correctly

**Key Test Cases**:

- API route file removal verification
- Endpoint 404 response validation
- Test file cleanup verification
- Integration test update validation
- Monitoring script update verification

**Success Criteria**:

- Each phase removes expected components
- No broken references introduced
- System remains stable during removal

### 3. Post-Removal Validation Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure complete removal and system integrity

**Key Test Cases**:

- Freshness endpoint returns 404
- All other health endpoints remain functional
- Monitoring systems work without freshness
- Application performance unchanged
- No freshness references remain in active code

**Success Criteria**:

- System operates normally without freshness API
- Monitoring coverage remains adequate
- No regression in core functionality

### 4. Regression Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure removal doesn't break existing functionality

**Key Test Areas**:

- Article reading and sync functionality
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Database operations and performance
- PM2 service management
- Build and deployment processes

**Success Criteria**:

- All core features work unchanged
- Performance metrics remain within baseline
- Monitoring and alerting continue functioning

## Database Function Analysis

### Functions Under Review

1. **count_articles_since(TIMESTAMPTZ)**
   - Primary usage: Freshness API only
   - Safe to remove: Yes (no other dependencies found)
   - Alternative: Direct SQL query if needed elsewhere

2. **count_all_articles()**
   - Primary usage: Freshness API only
   - Safe to remove: Yes (no other dependencies found)
   - Alternative: Direct SQL query if needed elsewhere

### Database Cleanup Options

1. **Option 1: Remove Functions** (Recommended)

   ```sql
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS count_articles_since(TIMESTAMPTZ);
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS count_all_articles();
   ```

2. **Option 2: Keep Functions** (Conservative)
   - Keep functions in case of future need
   - Document as unused after freshness removal
   - Monitor for actual usage

3. **Option 3: Revoke Permissions**
   ```sql
   REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION count_articles_since(TIMESTAMPTZ) FROM authenticated;
   REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION count_all_articles() FROM authenticated;
   ```

## Monitoring System Updates

### Scripts Requiring Updates

1. **monitor-dashboard.sh**
   - Remove `check_article_freshness()` function
   - Remove freshness section from output
   - Maintain all other monitoring functions

2. **sync-health-monitor.sh**
   - Remove freshness endpoint monitoring
   - Focus on sync server health endpoint
   - Maintain sync status tracking

3. **setup-sync-monitors.js**
   - Remove "RSS Reader - Article Freshness" monitor config
   - Keep all other Uptime Kuma monitor configurations
   - Update documentation

4. **validate-build.sh**
   - Remove freshness endpoint validation
   - Maintain other health endpoint checks
   - Ensure build process unaffected

### Uptime Kuma Monitor Changes

**Remove Monitor**:

- Name: "RSS Reader - Article Freshness"
- URL: `http://100.96.166.53:3000/reader/api/health/freshness`
- Type: HTTP monitor

**Keep Monitors**:

- RSS Reader - App Health
- RSS Reader - Database Health
- RSS Reader - Cron Health
- RSS Reader - Sync API Endpoint
- RSS Reader - Sync Success Rate (Push)

## Test Environment Considerations

### Development Environment

- Single environment: http://localhost:3000 or http://100.96.166.53:3000

- Supabase database with test data
- Tailscale network access required

### Test Data Requirements

- Articles in database for testing
- Valid OAuth tokens for sync testing
