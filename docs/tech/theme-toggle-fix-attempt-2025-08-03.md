# Theme Toggle Fix Attempt - August 3, 2025

## Issue: RR-126
Theme toggle button changes icons but doesn't apply the actual theme. App remains stuck in dark mode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ThemeProvider Component
**File**: `src/components/theme-provider.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added immediate theme application on mount
- Added a 10ms timeout to handle potential hydration timing issues
- Added debug logging to verify component mounting
- Wrapped theme application logic in a reusable `applyTheme` function

**Key additions**:
```typescript
// Apply immediately
applyTheme();

// Also apply after a short delay to handle any hydration issues
const timer = setTimeout(applyTheme, 10);

// Debug effect
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("[ThemeProvider] Mounted with theme:", theme);
  return () => console.log("[ThemeProvider] Unmounted");
}, []);
```

### 2. Created Pre-Hydration Theme Script
**File**: `src/lib/theme-script.ts` (NEW FILE)

**Purpose**: Apply theme before React hydrates to prevent flash of wrong theme

**Implementation**:
- Reads theme from localStorage `ui-store` key
- Parses Zustand persisted state structure
- Applies appropriate class (`light`, `dark`, or system preference) to documentElement
- Handles errors gracefully with fallback to system theme

### 3. Updated Root Layout
**File**: `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `themeScript`
- Added `<head>` section with script tag
- Script runs inline before body renders using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

**Addition**:
```typescript
<head>
  <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: themeScript }} />
</head>
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/theme-provider.tsx` - Enhanced with immediate application and debugging
2. `src/lib/theme-script.ts` - NEW - Pre-hydration theme application
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added head section with theme script

## Result
The fix did not resolve the issue. The theme toggle still doesn't work, suggesting the problem may be:
1. CSS configuration issue with Tailwind
2. Conflicting styles overriding theme classes
3. Different root cause than timing/hydration

## Next Investigation Areas
1. Verify Tailwind dark mode configuration is correct
2. Check for CSS specificity issues
3. Inspect computed styles when theme classes are applied
4. Test with a minimal theme implementation to isolate the issue
