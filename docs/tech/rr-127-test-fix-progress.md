# RR-127 Test Infrastructure Fix Progress

## Phase 0: Import Dependency Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
- Identified root cause: navigator undefined error in test-setup.ts
- Fixed global object initialization order
- Result: Tests can now load without "Object.defineProperty called on non-object" error

## Phase 1: Quick Infrastructure Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
1. **File Extension Fixes**
   - Renamed component test files from .ts to .tsx
   - Fixed: theme-provider.test.tsx, theme-toggle.test.tsx, rr-127-phase-1-infrastructure-fixes.test.tsx

2. **JSdom Navigation Fixes**
   - Updated test-setup.ts to handle window.location.reload gracefully
   - Created mock-helpers.ts for reusable window mocking

3. **Mock Hoisting Fixes**
   - Fixed "Cannot access before initialization" errors in multiple files
   - Moved mock definitions inside vi.mock() factories

## Phase 2: Systematic Test Discovery Fix ✅ COMPLETED
1. **E2E Test Separation**
   - Excluded Playwright E2E tests from Vitest config
   - E2E tests need separate runner configuration

2. **Singleton State Conflicts**
   - Root cause: HealthCheckService singleton with 10-second lock mechanism
   - Solution: Created mock pattern to prevent concurrent lock conflicts
   - Result: Test execution time reduced from timeout to ~550ms

3. **Test Discovery Success**
   - Fixed syntax errors preventing test loading
   - Tests now properly discovered (18 tests in rr-115-health-service-startup-dependencies.test.ts)

## Current Status

### Working Tests
- ✅ Individual test files run successfully when properly mocked
- ✅ rr-114-version-utility.test.ts: 11/11 passing
- ✅ rr-115-health-service-startup-dependencies.test.ts: 4/18 passing (14 need mock updates)

### Known Issues
1. **Health Service Tests**: Need to apply mock pattern to all tests using HealthCheckService
2. **Test Suite Timeouts**: Full suite times out due to singleton conflicts across files
3. **Resource Limits**: Must respect RR-123 constraints (maxConcurrency: 1, maxForks: 2)

## Next Steps (Phase 3: Mock Infrastructure Consolidation)
1. Apply health service mock pattern to:
   - rr-115-test-environment-configuration.test.ts
   - Other health endpoint tests

2. Create centralized mock configuration for:
   - Database mocks
   - Health service mocks
   - Environment mocks

3. Validate test isolation and resource usage

## Technical Insights
- The lock mechanism added in RR-115 (5-second cache) works in production but causes test conflicts
- Test environment needs full mocking to prevent singleton state sharing
- Individual tests work fine, but concurrent execution causes timeouts
- The safe-test-runner.sh enforces resource limits to prevent memory exhaustion (RR-123)

## Files Modified
- `/src/test-setup.ts` - Fixed global object initialization
- `/src/test-utils/mock-helpers.ts` - Created for window mocking utilities
- `/src/test-utils/health-check-mocks.ts` - Created for health service mocking
- Multiple test files - Fixed mock hoisting and file extensions
- `/vitest.config.ts` - Excluded E2E tests

## Metrics
- Before: 0 tests discovered in most files
- After: Tests properly discovered and executing
- Execution time: Reduced from timeout to <1 second per file when properly mocked
