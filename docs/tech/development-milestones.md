## Cross-Milestone Considerations

### Risk Management

**High-Risk Items:**

1. **API Rate Limits**: Inoreader's 100 calls/day limit could impact development
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive use of mock data, careful API usage tracking
2. **Claude API Costs**: Summarization costs could escalate quickly
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative usage limits, cost monitoring, content length limits
3. **Offline Sync Complexity**: Conflict resolution can be complex
   - **Mitigation**: Simple conflict resolution strategy, thorough testing

**Medium-Risk Items:**

1. **Performance on Low-End Devices**: PWA performance on older phones
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing, progressive enhancement
2. **Content Parsing Variability**: Different feed formats may break parsing
   - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, fallback content display

### Resource Requirements

**Development Environment**:

- Inoreader developer account with API access
- Anthropic API key with sufficient credits
- Vercel account for deployment
- Testing devices (iOS, Android, various screen sizes)

**External Dependencies**:

- Inoreader API stability and availability
- Anthropic Claude API access and pricing
- Third-party libraries and frameworks

### Quality Gates

Each milestone must pass these gates before proceeding:

1. **Functionality**: All success criteria met
2. **Performance**: Targets achieved
3. **Quality**: Code review and testing complete
4. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities
5. **API Usage**: Within sustainable limits

This milestone structure ensures steady progress while maintaining quality and managing risks effectively. Each milestone builds upon the previous one while delivering user value incrementally.
