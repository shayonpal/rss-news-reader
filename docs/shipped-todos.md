### TODO-037: Implement Bi-directional Sync to Inoreader (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
- **Issue**: Read/unread status changes made in the app are not synced back to Inoreader
- **Current Behavior**: Sync is one-way only (Inoreader → Server → Supabase → Client)
- **Expected Behavior**: Changes made in the app should sync back to Inoreader
- **Context**: Architecture supports bi-directional sync but implementation was deferred
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Track all read/unread status changes in the app
  - [x] Implement offline queue for status changes
  - [x] Batch changes to minimize API calls
  - [x] Use `/edit-tag` endpoint to update Inoreader
  - [x] Handle conflicts (most recent change wins)
  - [x] Sync back changes during regular sync operations
  - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed sync attempts
  - [x] Display sync status for bi-directional operations
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create sync_queue table for tracking pending changes
  - Add timestamp to all read/unread actions
  - Batch updates during sync process (max 50 items per call)
  - Use Inoreader's `/edit-tag` API endpoint
  - Clear queue items after successful sync
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to track article Inoreader IDs for sync back
  - Consider rate limiting impact (100 calls/day limit)
  - Handle offline scenarios gracefully
  - Prevent sync loops (changes from Inoreader shouldn't trigger sync back)
- **API Endpoint**:
  ```
  POST https://www.inoreader.com/reader/api/0/edit-tag
  Parameters:
  - a: Article ID (Inoreader format)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (to mark as read)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (with param r=user/-/state/com.google/read to mark as unread)
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Complete synchronization across all devices
  - Changes persist in Inoreader ecosystem
  - Better integration with other Inoreader clients
  - Reduced confusion about read state
- **Completed**: July 23, 2025 - Feature fully implemented and verified working. The only issue was the sync server wasn't running in production. Once started, all functionality worked as designed with efficient batching and proper error handling.

### TODO-038: Fix Client-Side Sync Queue RPC Calls (P2 - Bug) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - SQL function syntax error fixed
- **Issue**: Client-side article store failed to add entries to sync_queue via RPC
- **Root Cause**: SQL syntax error in add_to_sync_queue function - CASE statement with arrays
- **Solution**: Fixed function to use IF/ELSIF instead of CASE with arrays
- **Completed**: January 22, 2025
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Added error handling to RPC calls
  - `/src/lib/db/migrations/008_fix_sync_queue_function.sql` - Fixed function syntax
- **Verification**: Tested with Playwright - sync queue now properly records read/star actions

### TODO-041: Fix Cron Sync URL Missing /reader Prefix (P0 - Critical Bug)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Automatic sync has been failing since deployment because cron service calls wrong URL
- **Root Cause**: Cron service configured to call `http://localhost:3147/api/sync` but app uses `/reader` basePath
- **Evidence**: 
  - All automatic syncs failing with "fetch failed" or "404" errors since July 22
  - Manual test confirms `/api/sync` returns 404, but `/reader/api/sync` works correctly
  - Logs show consistent failures at 2:00 AM and 2:00 PM daily
- **Current Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  // ecosystem.config.js line 91
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3147'  // Missing /reader prefix
  ```
- **Fix Applied**: Updated ecosystem.config.js to use environment variable with correct default:
  ```javascript
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3147/reader'
  ```
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Update ecosystem.config.js to use correct URL with /reader prefix
  - [x] Use environment variable instead of hardcoding URL
  - [x] Test manual sync via cron service succeeds - Tested at 2:35 AM
  - [x] Verify automatic sync runs successfully at next scheduled time - Completed in 4.4 seconds
  - [ ] Update deployment documentation if needed
- **Impact**: HIGH - No automatic syncs have been running in production
- **Discovered**: July 23, 2025 at 2:19 AM EDT (just after failed 2:00 AM sync)
- **Fixed**: July 23, 2025 - Applied environment variable approach with correct /reader prefix

### TODO-046: Fix Orange Status Bar in PWA on iPhone (P1 - UI Bug) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Orange header/status bar appears above app header when saved as PWA on iPhone
- **Context**:
  - When RSS reader is saved as a web app on iPhone, an orange bar appears above the app header
  - The status bar should match the app header color (black in dark mode)
  - This creates a visual inconsistency in the PWA experience
  - @screenshot.png shows orange status bar with black app header below
- **Evidence**: User provided @screenshot.png showing orange status bar in PWA mode
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Missing or incorrect `theme-color` meta tag
  - PWA manifest not properly configured for status bar
  - iOS Safari PWA viewport configuration issues
  - Missing `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` meta tag
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅

  - CSS classes apply safe area padding only in PWA mode
  - No extra padding in regular browser mode
  - Fixed article title cutoff with conditional padding
- **Completed**: July 24, 2025

### TODO-047: Filter Out Feeds with No Unread Articles in Sidebar (P2 - Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: When "Unread Only" filter is selected, feeds with zero unread articles still appear in sidebar
- **Context**:
  - Currently, the "Unread Only" filter only affects the article list
  - Sidebar continues to show all feeds, even those with 0 unread count
  - This creates visual clutter and makes it harder to find feeds with unread content
  - Users expect feeds with no unread articles to be hidden when filtering for unread
- **User Story**: As a user filtering for unread articles, I want feeds with no unread articles to be hidden in the sidebar so I can quickly see which feeds have new content
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] When "Unread Only" filter is active, hide feeds with 0 unread count
  - [x] When "Read Only" or "All Articles" is selected, show all feeds
  - [x] Maintain folder structure (hide empty folders too) - N/A (no folders in use)
  - [x] Show folder only if it contains feeds with unread articles - N/A (no folders in use)
  - [x] Update feed counts dynamically as articles are read
  - [x] Preserve feed selection if switching between filters (selected feed stays visible)
  - [x] Add smooth transitions when feeds appear/disappear
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Added check for `readStatusFilter` from article store
  - Filter feeds based on unread count > 0 when filter is "unread"
  - Currently selected feed always remains visible even if 0 unread
  - Scroll position preserved when switching filters
- **Edge Cases**: ALL HANDLED ✅
  - "All Articles" feed always remains visible
  - Selected feed with 0 unread stays visible until deselected
  - No folder structures currently in use
  - Unread counts update in real-time
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` - Added filtering logic and scroll preservation
- **Completed**: Thursday, July 24, 2025 at 8:15 AM

### TODO-048: Grey Out Feeds with No Unread Articles in Sidebar (P3 - UI Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Feeds with zero unread articles have the same visual prominence as feeds with new content
- **Context**:
  - Currently all feeds appear with the same opacity/color regardless of unread count
  - Users need to look at the unread count badge to identify feeds with new content
  - Visual hierarchy would help users quickly scan for feeds with unread articles
  - This enhancement applies when viewing "All Articles" or "Read Only" filters
  - This is a less aggressive approach than TODO-047 (hiding feeds completely)
- **User Story**: As a user, I want feeds with no unread articles to be visually de-emphasized so I can quickly identify feeds with new content
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Feeds with 0 unread count appear with reduced opacity (35%)
  - [x] Feeds with unread articles maintain full opacity
  - [x] Apply to both feed names and icons
  - [x] Unread count badge removed for feeds with zero unread
  - [x] Hover state temporarily restores full opacity
  - [x] Selected feed maintains full opacity even if no unread
  - [x] Works in both light and dark themes
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Added conditional opacity (35%) based on unread count
  - Used Tailwind CSS classes with smooth transitions
  - Removed "0" badges for cleaner appearance
  - Applied to both SimpleFeedSidebar and FeedTreeItem components
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` - Applied conditional styling
  - `src/components/feeds/feed-tree-item.tsx` - Applied same logic for consistency
- **Completed**: July 24, 2025 - Visual hierarchy implemented

### TODO-049: Sort Feed List Alphabetically in Sidebar (P2 - Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Feeds in sidebar are not consistently sorted, making it difficult to find specific feeds
- **Context**:
  - Currently feeds appear to be sorted by their Inoreader order or creation time
  - Users expect alphabetical sorting for easier navigation
  - With 69+ feeds, finding a specific feed without alphabetical order is challenging
  - Alphabetical sorting is a standard pattern in RSS readers
- **User Story**: As a user with many feeds, I want feeds sorted alphabetically so I can quickly locate specific feeds
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] All feeds within a folder are sorted alphabetically (A-Z)
  - [x] Sort is case-insensitive
  - [x] Folders themselves are sorted alphabetically
  - [x] Feeds at root level (no folder) are sorted alphabetically
  - [x] "All Articles" special feed remains at the top
  - [x] Sorting persists across app sessions
  - [x] New feeds are inserted in correct alphabetical position
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Sorted feeds by title in both component and feed store
  - Used `localeCompare()` with numeric option for proper internationalization
  - Applied sorting in SimpleFeedSidebar component and getFeedsInFolder method
  - Performance is good with current feed count
- **Sorting Rules**:
  1. "All Articles" always first
  2. Folders sorted alphabetically (no folders currently in use)
  3. Within each folder, feeds sorted alphabetically
  4. Root-level feeds sorted alphabetically
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` - Added sorting when converting feeds Map to array
  - `src/lib/stores/feed-store.ts` - Added sorting to getFeedsInFolder method
- **Completed**: July 24, 2025 - Feeds now appear in alphabetical order
