  - [x] Consider adding Node.js engine requirement to package.json
- **Implementation**:
  ```bash
  npm install punycode --save
  ```
  - The npm package `punycode` v2.x is actively maintained
  - This ensures compatibility when Node.js removes the built-in module
  - Deprecation warnings eliminated
- **Completed**: January 23, 2025 - Technical debt resolved

#### TODO-028: Enhance Back Button Navigation Logic (P2 - UX Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Back button should always return to listing page instead of previous article
- **Current Behavior**: Back button uses browser history which may go to previous article when user has navigated through multiple articles using Previous/Next buttons
- **Expected Behavior**: Back button should consistently return to the article listing page, preserving filter state and scroll position
- **Use Case**: User navigates through multiple articles using UI Previous/Next buttons, then wants to return to the article list
- **Context**: Builds on scroll position preservation from TODO-009a
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Back button in article view always navigates to listing page (never to previous article)
  - [x] Preserve current feed filter when returning to listing
  - [x] Preserve current read status filter when returning to listing
  - [x] Restore scroll position to where user was before viewing first article
  - [x] Works correctly regardless of how user navigated to current article (direct link, Previous/Next buttons, etc.)
  - [x] Browser back button should still work as expected (respecting browser history)
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified back button to use `router.push('/')` instead of `router.back()`
  - Filter and scroll position preservation already handled by sessionStorage from TODO-009a
  - Simple one-line change that leverages existing state management
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx` - Changed onBack handler to always push to '/'
- **Completed**: January 23, 2025 - Back button now consistently returns to listing page

#### TODO-029: Auto-Mark Articles as Read on Scroll (P2 - UX Enhancement)
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Articles should automatically be marked as read when they scroll out of viewport
- **Current Behavior**: Articles must be manually clicked to be marked as read
- **Expected Behavior**: As user scrolls down the article list, articles that leave the viewport should automatically be marked as read
- **Use Case**: User scrolls through article list to quickly scan headlines, articles they've seen should be automatically marked as read
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Detect when article list items scroll out of viewport (top edge)
  - [ ] Mark article as read when it completely leaves viewport
  - [ ] Only mark as read when scrolling down (not when scrolling up)
  - [ ] Debounce/throttle scroll events for performance
  - [ ] Visual feedback when article is marked as read (smooth opacity transition)
  - [ ] Option to disable this feature in settings (future enhancement)
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Use Intersection Observer API to detect when articles leave viewport
  - Track scroll direction to only mark on downward scroll
  - Batch API calls to update read status
  - Add smooth visual transition when marking as read
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx` - Add Intersection Observer logic
  - `src/stores/article-store.ts` - Add batch mark as read functionality
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `IntersectionObserver` with `rootMargin` to detect when article leaves top
  - Throttle updates to avoid excessive API calls
  - Consider viewport height to determine appropriate trigger point
  - Ensure works with infinite scroll/pagination

#### TODO-030: iOS Scroll-to-Top Gesture Support (P1 - Platform UX) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - July 22, 2025
- **Issue**: iOS native scroll-to-top gesture (tap status bar) and Safari URL bar collapse didn't work
- **Root Cause**: Safari requires document body to scroll, not inner containers
- **Solution**: Restructured layout to use natural document flow instead of constrained containers
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Changed layout from `h-screen` to `min-h-screen`
  - Removed all `overflow-y-auto` from inner containers
  - Made sidebar sticky instead of fixed height on desktop
  - Updated scroll tracking to use `window.scrollY`
  - Fixed hydration error with `useHydrationFix` hook for localStorage
  - Added `viewportFit: "cover"` to viewport configuration
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Status bar tap scrolls article list to top on home page
  - [x] Status bar tap scrolls article content to top in article view
  - [x] Works on both iPhone and iPad
  - [x] Smooth scroll animation matches iOS native behavior
  - [x] Works in both portrait and landscape orientations
  - [x] Respects current scroll container (list vs article)
  - [x] Safari URL bar properly collapses when scrolling
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Changed to min-h-screen, sticky sidebar
  - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx` - Removed scroll container
  - `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx` - Removed scroll wrapper
  - `src/app/globals.css` - Cleaned up iOS scroll CSS
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added viewport-fit cover
  - `src/hooks/use-hydration-fix.ts` - Created for localStorage sync
  - `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Fixed SSR localStorage access
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Safari only triggers scroll-to-top when document body scrolls
  - URL bar collapse also requires body-level scrolling
  - Perplexity confirmed this is a known Safari limitation
  - Solution follows Safari's expected behavior patterns

#### TODO-031: Document Internal APIs (P2 - Documentation)
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Internal API endpoints need better documentation
- **Current State**: Basic documentation exists in `docs/api/server-endpoints.md` but needs enhancement
- **Expected Result**: Complete API reference in `docs/api/server-endpoints.md`
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Update `docs/api/server-endpoints.md` with any missing endpoints
  - [ ] Add curl command examples for each endpoint
  - [ ] Document any new endpoints added since initial documentation
  - [ ] Add authentication/security notes
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Add examples of error scenarios
- **Additional Endpoints to Document**:
  - `GET /api/test-supabase` - Database connection test
  - `GET /api/test-refresh-stats` - Refresh materialized view test
  - `POST /api/sync/metadata` - Update sync metadata
  - Any other endpoints not currently in the docs
- **Enhancement Areas**:
  - Add curl examples for testing
  - Document response headers
  - Include timing/performance notes
  - Add debugging tips

#### TODO-032: Document Database Schema in README (P2 - Documentation) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Database schema fully documented
- **Issue**: Supabase database schema was not documented in README.md
- **Completed**: January 22, 2025
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Document all 7 tables with their purposes
  - [x] List all columns with data types and constraints
  - [x] Explain relationships between tables
  - [x] Document indexes and their purposes
  - [x] Document RLS policies
  - [x] Include example queries for common operations
- **Implementation**:
  - Added comprehensive Database Schema section to README.md
  - Documented all 7 tables in detail with markdown tables
  - Included column descriptions, constraints, and indexes
  - Added materialized view and database functions documentation
  - Documented RLS policies for all tables
  - Provided visual table relationship diagram
  - Included common SQL query examples

#### TODO-037: Implement Bi-directional Sync to Inoreader (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (Jan 22, 2025)
- **Issue**: Read/unread status changes made in the app are not synced back to Inoreader
- **Current Behavior**: Sync is one-way only (Inoreader → Server → Supabase → Client)
- **Expected Behavior**: Changes made in the app should sync back to Inoreader
- **Context**: Architecture supports bi-directional sync but implementation was deferred
- **User Story**: US-102 mentions this as a future feature
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Track all read/unread status changes in the app
  - [ ] Implement offline queue for status changes
  - [ ] Batch changes to minimize API calls
  - [ ] Use `/edit-tag` endpoint to update Inoreader
  - [ ] Handle conflicts (most recent change wins)
  - [ ] Sync back changes during regular sync operations
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed sync attempts
  - [ ] Display sync status for bi-directional operations
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create sync_queue table for tracking pending changes
  - Add timestamp to all read/unread actions
  - Batch updates during sync process (max 50 items per call)
  - Use Inoreader's `/edit-tag` API endpoint
  - Clear queue items after successful sync
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to track article Inoreader IDs for sync back
  - Consider rate limiting impact (100 calls/day limit)
  - Handle offline scenarios gracefully
  - Prevent sync loops (changes from Inoreader shouldn't trigger sync back)
- **API Endpoint**:
  ```
  POST https://www.inoreader.com/reader/api/0/edit-tag
  Parameters:
  - a: Article ID (Inoreader format)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (to mark as read)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (with param r=user/-/state/com.google/read to mark as unread)
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Complete synchronization across all devices
  - Changes persist in Inoreader ecosystem
  - Better integration with other Inoreader clients
  - Reduced confusion about read state

#### TODO-038: Fix Client-Side Sync Queue RPC Calls (P2 - Bug) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - SQL function syntax error fixed
- **Issue**: Client-side article store failed to add entries to sync_queue via RPC
- **Root Cause**: SQL syntax error in add_to_sync_queue function - CASE statement with arrays
- **Solution**: Fixed function to use IF/ELSIF instead of CASE with arrays
- **Completed**: January 22, 2025
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Added error handling to RPC calls
  - `/src/lib/db/migrations/008_fix_sync_queue_function.sql` - Fixed function syntax
- **Verification**: Tested with Playwright - sync queue now properly records read/star actions
