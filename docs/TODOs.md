### TODO-037: Implement Bi-directional Sync to Inoreader (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
- **Issue**: Read/unread status changes made in the app are not synced back to Inoreader
- **Current Behavior**: Sync is one-way only (Inoreader → Server → Supabase → Client)
- **Expected Behavior**: Changes made in the app should sync back to Inoreader
- **Context**: Architecture supports bi-directional sync but implementation was deferred
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Track all read/unread status changes in the app
  - [x] Implement offline queue for status changes
  - [x] Batch changes to minimize API calls
  - [x] Use `/edit-tag` endpoint to update Inoreader
  - [x] Handle conflicts (most recent change wins)
  - [x] Sync back changes during regular sync operations
  - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed sync attempts
  - [x] Display sync status for bi-directional operations
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create sync_queue table for tracking pending changes
  - Add timestamp to all read/unread actions
  - Batch updates during sync process (max 50 items per call)
  - Use Inoreader's `/edit-tag` API endpoint
  - Clear queue items after successful sync
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to track article Inoreader IDs for sync back
  - Consider rate limiting impact (100 calls/day limit)
  - Handle offline scenarios gracefully
  - Prevent sync loops (changes from Inoreader shouldn't trigger sync back)
- **API Endpoint**:
  ```
  POST https://www.inoreader.com/reader/api/0/edit-tag
  Parameters:
  - a: Article ID (Inoreader format)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (to mark as read)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (with param r=user/-/state/com.google/read to mark as unread)
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Complete synchronization across all devices
  - Changes persist in Inoreader ecosystem
  - Better integration with other Inoreader clients
  - Reduced confusion about read state
- **Completed**: July 23, 2025 - Feature fully implemented and verified working. The only issue was the sync server wasn't running in production. Once started, all functionality worked as designed with efficient batching and proper error handling.

- **Implementation**:
  ```bash
  npm install punycode --save --legacy-peer-deps
  ```
  - The npm package `punycode` v2.3.1 is actively maintained
  - This ensures compatibility when Node.js removes the built-in module
  - Deprecation warnings eliminated
  - Note: Required `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to peer dependency conflicts with @vitest/ui
- **Completed**: July 22, 2025 - Technical debt resolved (re-applied with legacy-peer-deps)

### TODO-028: Enhance Back Button Navigation Logic (P2 - UX Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Back button should always return to listing page instead of previous article
- **Current Behavior**: Back button uses browser history which may go to previous article when user has navigated through multiple articles using Previous/Next buttons
- **Expected Behavior**: Back button should consistently return to the article listing page, preserving filter state and scroll position
- **Use Case**: User navigates through multiple articles using UI Previous/Next buttons, then wants to return to the article list
- **Context**: Builds on scroll position preservation from TODO-009a
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Back button in article view always navigates to listing page (never to previous article)
  - [x] Preserve current feed filter when returning to listing
  - [x] Preserve current read status filter when returning to listing
  - [x] Restore scroll position to where user was before viewing first article
  - [x] Works correctly regardless of how user navigated to current article (direct link, Previous/Next buttons, etc.)
  - [x] Browser back button should still work as expected (respecting browser history)
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified back button to use `router.push('/')` instead of `router.back()`
  - Filter and scroll position preservation already handled by sessionStorage from TODO-009a
  - Simple one-line change that leverages existing state management
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/article/[id]/page.tsx` - Changed onBack handler to always push to '/'
- **Completed**: January 23, 2025 - Back button now consistently returns to listing page

### TODO-029: Auto-Mark Articles as Read on Scroll (P2 - UX Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Articles should automatically be marked as read when they scroll out of viewport
- **Implementation**: Articles now automatically marked as read when scrolling down past them
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Detect when article list items scroll out of viewport (top edge)
  - [x] Mark article as read when it completely leaves viewport
  - [x] Only mark as read when scrolling down (not when scrolling up)
  - [x] Debounce/throttle scroll events for performance (500ms batch)
  - [x] Visual feedback when article is marked as read (smooth opacity transition)
  - [x] Articles remain visible until view changes (no jarring UI changes)
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Used Intersection Observer API to detect when articles leave viewport
  - Track scroll direction with `window.scrollY` comparison
  - Batch API calls with 500ms debounce for efficiency
  - Created `markMultipleAsRead` function in article store
  - Works on all article views (not just "unread only" filter)
  - Articles fade to 70% opacity when marked as read
  - Added Reddit-style auto-hiding header on scroll
  - Simplified article list headers (removed redundant text)
  - Fixed mobile text truncation for long folder names
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx` - Added Intersection Observer logic
  - `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Added batch mark as read functionality
  - `src/lib/article-count-manager.ts` - Simplified header titles
  - `src/components/articles/article-header.tsx` - Fixed text wrapping
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Added auto-hiding header behavior

### TODO-030: iOS Scroll-to-Top Gesture Support (P1 - Platform UX) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - July 22, 2025
- **Issue**: iOS native scroll-to-top gesture (tap status bar) and Safari URL bar collapse didn't work
- **Root Cause**: Safari requires document body to scroll, not inner containers
- **Solution**: Restructured layout to use natural document flow instead of constrained containers
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Changed layout from `h-screen` to `min-h-screen`
  - Removed all `overflow-y-auto` from inner containers
  - Made sidebar sticky instead of fixed height on desktop
  - Updated scroll tracking to use `window.scrollY`
  - Fixed hydration error with `useHydrationFix` hook for localStorage
  - Added `viewportFit: "cover"` to viewport configuration
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Status bar tap scrolls article list to top on home page
  - [x] Status bar tap scrolls article content to top in article view
  - [x] Works on both iPhone and iPad
  - [x] Smooth scroll animation matches iOS native behavior
  - [x] Works in both portrait and landscape orientations
  - [x] Respects current scroll container (list vs article)
  - [x] Safari URL bar properly collapses when scrolling
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Changed to min-h-screen, sticky sidebar
  - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx` - Removed scroll container
  - `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx` - Removed scroll wrapper
  - `src/app/globals.css` - Cleaned up iOS scroll CSS
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added viewport-fit cover
  - `src/hooks/use-hydration-fix.ts` - Created for localStorage sync
  - `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Fixed SSR localStorage access
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Safari only triggers scroll-to-top when document body scrolls
  - URL bar collapse also requires body-level scrolling
  - Perplexity confirmed this is a known Safari limitation
  - Solution follows Safari's expected behavior patterns
