### TODO-016: Sync Status Display (P1 - UX)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Current**: Basic progress display exists
- **Note**: As of July 22, 2025 5pm check, some sync status info is already displayed in the sidebar:

### TODO-040: Fix or Remove Unused Mark-All-Read Route (P2 - Technical Debt)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: `/api/mark-all-read` route exists but is not integrated into the UI
- **Context**:
  - Route was created but never connected to any frontend components
  - Causes build issues because it initializes Supabase client at module level
  - Build fails when environment variables aren't available during static generation
  - Currently worked around by temporarily renaming file during build
- **Root Cause**: Supabase client is initialized outside the POST function, which runs during build time when env vars may not be available
- **Options**:
  1. **Fix the route**: Move Supabase client initialization inside the POST function (lazy loading)
  2. **Remove the route**: Delete if the feature isn't planned for implementation
  3. **Implement the feature**: Add UI buttons to mark all articles as read in a feed/folder
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Decide whether to fix, remove, or implement the feature
  - [ ] If fixing: Move `createClient()` call inside the POST handler
  - [ ] If removing: Delete the route file entirely
  - [ ] If implementing: Add "Mark all as read" buttons to feed/folder context menus
  - [ ] Build completes without workarounds
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - The route is designed to mark all articles in a feed or folder as read
  - Would be useful for users who want to clear unread counts quickly
  - Similar functionality exists in most RSS readers

### TODO-042: Fix Sync Overwriting Local Star/Read Status (P0 - Critical Bug)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Sync from Inoreader overwrites local star/read status changes
- **Root Cause**:
  - User stars/marks articles as read locally → Updates `is_starred`/`is_read` in DB
  - Changes are queued for bidirectional sync → Added to `sync_queue` table
  - Bidirectional sync runs (every 5 min) → Sends changes to Inoreader
  - BUT: Regular sync from Inoreader (2AM/2PM) → Fetches articles and overwrites ALL fields including `is_starred`/`is_read`
  - This happens because sync uses `upsert` without checking `last_local_update` timestamp
- **Evidence**:
  - 0 articles currently starred in DB (despite user starring articles)
  - 26 articles have `last_local_update > last_sync_update`
  - Sync code unconditionally sets: `is_starred: article.categories?.includes('user/-/state/com.google/starred') || false`
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Sync should check `last_local_update` before overwriting `is_read`/`is_starred`
  - [ ] If local update is newer than sync timestamp, preserve local values
  - [ ] Add tests to verify local changes aren't overwritten
  - [ ] Ensure bidirectional sync changes are preserved
- **Files to modify**:
  - `src/app/api/sync/route.ts` - Add timestamp comparison logic
  - Consider creating a merge strategy for sync conflicts
- **Testing**:
  - Star an article locally
  - Wait for bidirectional sync to complete
  - Trigger manual sync from Inoreader
  - Verify starred status is preserved

### TODO-043: Fix Favicon Not Loading on iPad in Production (P1 - Bug)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Favicon not loading in production app on iPad
- **Context**:
  - Production URL: http://100.96.166.53:3147/reader
  - The favicon may not be loading due to basePath configuration or PWA manifest issues
  - Related to previous TODO-010 which fixed 404 errors for missing assets
- **Evidence**: User reports favicon not appearing when accessing the app on iPad
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Incorrect favicon path with /reader basePath prefix
  - PWA manifest not properly configured for iPad
  - Safari-specific favicon requirements not met
  - Missing Apple touch icon variants
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Investigate current favicon configuration in metadata
  - [ ] Check if favicon URLs include proper /reader basePath prefix
  - [ ] Verify PWA manifest icons configuration
  - [ ] Test favicon loading on iPad Safari in production
  - [ ] Ensure all required Apple touch icon sizes are present
  - [ ] Add appropriate meta tags for Safari/iOS if missing
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Check `src/app/layout.tsx` metadata configuration
  - Verify files exist in `public/` directory
  - May need iPad-specific icon sizes (152x152, 167x167, 180x180)
  - Consider using absolute URLs for production environment

### TODO-044: Open All Article Links in External Tab (P2 - Enhancement)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Links within article content open in the same tab, causing users to lose their place
- **Context**:
  - Users reading articles may click on links within the content
  - Currently these links navigate away from the RSS reader
  - Users must use browser back button to return to their article
- **User Story**: As a user reading articles, I want all links within article content to open in new tabs so I don't lose my reading position
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] All links in article content open in new tab (target="\_blank")
  - [ ] Add rel="noopener noreferrer" for security
  - [ ] Apply to both RSS content and full fetched content
  - [ ] Apply to AI summary content if it contains links
  - [ ] Ensure external link icon indicator if space permits
  - [ ] Test on both desktop and mobile/iPad
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Option 1: Add link processing in article content rendering
  - Option 2: Use CSS/JavaScript to add target="\_blank" to all links
  - Option 3: Process content server-side before storing
  - Consider using DOMParser or regex to modify links
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx` - Article content display
  - Utility function for link processing
  - May need to handle different content types (RSS, full content, AI summary)
- **Testing Notes**:
  - Test with articles containing various link types
  - Ensure no breaking of existing link functionality
  - Verify security attributes are properly added

### TODO-045: Enable Native Share Sheet on Apple Devices (P2 - Enhancement)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Share button doesn't use native share functionality on Apple devices
- **Context**:
  - Share button currently exists in the article dropdown menu
  - On Apple devices (iOS/macOS), users expect native share sheet
  - On other devices, copying URL with toast notification is sufficient
- **User Story**: As a user on an Apple device, I want the share button to open the native share sheet so I can easily share articles using my preferred apps
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Detect if user is on Apple device (iOS Safari, macOS Safari, or PWA)
  - [ ] On Apple devices: Use Web Share API to open native share sheet
  - [ ] On non-Apple devices: Copy article URL to clipboard
  - [ ] Show toast notification when URL is copied (non-Apple devices)
  - [ ] Include article title and URL in share data
  - [ ] Fallback to clipboard copy if Web Share API fails
  - [ ] Test on iPad, iPhone, Mac, and non-Apple devices
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use `navigator.share()` API for native sharing
  - Check `navigator.userAgent` or feature detection
  - Share data should include: title, text (description), url
  - Toast notification using existing UI patterns
- **Code Example**:

  ```typescript
  const shareArticle = async () => {
    const shareData = {
      title: article.title,
      text: article.description || article.title,
      url: article.url,
    };

    if (navigator.share && /iPhone|iPad|Mac/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
      try {
        await navigator.share(shareData);
      } catch (err) {
        // Fallback to clipboard
      }
    } else {
      // Copy to clipboard with toast
    }
  };
  ```

- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx` - Share button implementation
  - May need a utility function for device detection
  - Toast notification component/hook

- **Issue**: Orange header/status bar appears above app header when saved as PWA on iPhone
- **Context**:
  - When RSS reader is saved as a web app on iPhone, an orange bar appears above the app header
  - The status bar should match the app header color (black in dark mode)
  - This creates a visual inconsistency in the PWA experience
  - @screenshot.png shows orange status bar with black app header below
- **Evidence**: User provided @screenshot.png showing orange status bar in PWA mode
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Missing or incorrect `theme-color` meta tag
  - PWA manifest not properly configured for status bar
  - iOS Safari PWA viewport configuration issues
  - Missing `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` meta tag
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅

  - CSS classes apply safe area padding only in PWA mode
  - No extra padding in regular browser mode
  - Fixed article title cutoff with conditional padding
- **Completed**: July 24, 2025

### TODO-047: Filter Out Feeds with No Unread Articles in Sidebar (P2 - Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: When "Unread Only" filter is selected, feeds with zero unread articles still appear in sidebar
- **Context**:
  - Currently, the "Unread Only" filter only affects the article list
  - Sidebar continues to show all feeds, even those with 0 unread count
  - This creates visual clutter and makes it harder to find feeds with unread content
  - Users expect feeds with no unread articles to be hidden when filtering for unread
- **User Story**: As a user filtering for unread articles, I want feeds with no unread articles to be hidden in the sidebar so I can quickly see which feeds have new content
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] When "Unread Only" filter is active, hide feeds with 0 unread count
  - [x] When "Read Only" or "All Articles" is selected, show all feeds
  - [x] Maintain folder structure (hide empty folders too) - N/A (no folders in use)
  - [x] Show folder only if it contains feeds with unread articles - N/A (no folders in use)
  - [x] Update feed counts dynamically as articles are read
  - [x] Preserve feed selection if switching between filters (selected feed stays visible)
  - [x] Add smooth transitions when feeds appear/disappear
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Added check for `readStatusFilter` from article store
  - Filter feeds based on unread count > 0 when filter is "unread"
  - Currently selected feed always remains visible even if 0 unread
  - Scroll position preserved when switching filters
- **Edge Cases**: ALL HANDLED ✅
  - "All Articles" feed always remains visible
  - Selected feed with 0 unread stays visible until deselected
  - No folder structures currently in use
  - Unread counts update in real-time
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` - Added filtering logic and scroll preservation
- **Completed**: Thursday, July 24, 2025 at 8:15 AM

### TODO-048: Grey Out Feeds with No Unread Articles in Sidebar (P3 - UI Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Feeds with zero unread articles have the same visual prominence as feeds with new content
- **Context**:
  - Currently all feeds appear with the same opacity/color regardless of unread count
  - Users need to look at the unread count badge to identify feeds with new content
  - Visual hierarchy would help users quickly scan for feeds with unread articles
  - This enhancement applies when viewing "All Articles" or "Read Only" filters
  - This is a less aggressive approach than TODO-047 (hiding feeds completely)
- **User Story**: As a user, I want feeds with no unread articles to be visually de-emphasized so I can quickly identify feeds with new content
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Feeds with 0 unread count appear with reduced opacity (35%)
  - [x] Feeds with unread articles maintain full opacity
  - [x] Apply to both feed names and icons
  - [x] Unread count badge removed for feeds with zero unread
  - [x] Hover state temporarily restores full opacity
  - [x] Selected feed maintains full opacity even if no unread
  - [x] Works in both light and dark themes
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Added conditional opacity (35%) based on unread count
  - Used Tailwind CSS classes with smooth transitions
  - Removed "0" badges for cleaner appearance
  - Applied to both SimpleFeedSidebar and FeedTreeItem components
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` - Applied conditional styling
  - `src/components/feeds/feed-tree-item.tsx` - Applied same logic for consistency
- **Completed**: July 24, 2025 - Visual hierarchy implemented

### TODO-049: Sort Feed List Alphabetically in Sidebar (P2 - Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Feeds in sidebar are not consistently sorted, making it difficult to find specific feeds
- **Context**:
  - Currently feeds appear to be sorted by their Inoreader order or creation time
  - Users expect alphabetical sorting for easier navigation
  - With 69+ feeds, finding a specific feed without alphabetical order is challenging
  - Alphabetical sorting is a standard pattern in RSS readers
- **User Story**: As a user with many feeds, I want feeds sorted alphabetically so I can quickly locate specific feeds
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] All feeds within a folder are sorted alphabetically (A-Z)
  - [x] Sort is case-insensitive
  - [x] Folders themselves are sorted alphabetically
  - [x] Feeds at root level (no folder) are sorted alphabetically
  - [x] "All Articles" special feed remains at the top
  - [x] Sorting persists across app sessions
  - [x] New feeds are inserted in correct alphabetical position
- **Implementation Details**: COMPLETED ✅
  - Sorted feeds by title in both component and feed store
  - Used `localeCompare()` with numeric option for proper internationalization
  - Applied sorting in SimpleFeedSidebar component and getFeedsInFolder method
  - Performance is good with current feed count
- **Sorting Rules**:
  1. "All Articles" always first
  2. Folders sorted alphabetically (no folders currently in use)

  }

  .article-action-icon:hover {
    opacity: 1;
  }

  .article-action-icon.active {
    opacity: 1;
    color: theme("colors.primary");
  }
  ```

- **Files to Modify**:

### TODO-052: Investigate Read Status Sync Issues with Inoreader (P0 - Critical Bug)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: Read status appears to be lost after sync, articles marked as read become unread again
- **Context**:
  - User reports losing read status of articles after every sync
  - This could be related to TODO-042 (Sync Overwriting Local Star/Read Status)
  - Bi-directional sync was implemented in TODO-037 but may have issues
  - Critical bug affecting core functionality and user experience
- **Evidence**:
  - User feels read status is lost after sync operations
  - Articles previously marked as read appear as unread
  - May be happening during the 2 AM/2 PM automatic syncs
- **Potential Root Causes**:
  1. Sync overwriting local changes (similar to TODO-042)
  2. Bi-directional sync not working correctly
  3. Timing issue between local update and sync
  4. Sync queue not processing read status changes
  5. Inoreader API not accepting read status updates
  6. Conflict resolution favoring Inoreader state over local
- **Investigation Steps**:
  - [ ] Check sync_queue table for pending read status changes
  - [ ] Verify bi-directional sync server is running (port 3001)
  - [ ] Monitor sync logs during read status changes
  - [ ] Check if last_local_update timestamps are being respected
  - [ ] Test manual sync after marking articles as read
  - [ ] Verify Inoreader API calls are successful
  - [ ] Check for any error logs in bidirectional sync
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Identify root cause of read status loss
  - [ ] Document the exact sync flow and timing
  - [ ] Implement fix to preserve read status
  - [ ] Test that read status persists through multiple sync cycles
  - [ ] Ensure both manual and automatic syncs preserve status
  - [ ] Add logging to track read status changes
- **Debugging Queries**:

  ```sql
  -- Check sync queue for pending items
  SELECT * FROM sync_queue
  WHERE action = 'mark_read'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC;

  -- Check articles with local updates newer than sync
  SELECT id, title, is_read, last_local_update, last_sync_update
  FROM articles
  WHERE last_local_update > last_sync_update;

  -- Check recent sync operations
  SELECT * FROM sync_metadata
  ORDER BY last_sync DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- **Related TODOs**:
  - TODO-037: Bi-directional sync implementation
  - TODO-042: Sync overwriting local star/read status
  - TODO-038: Fixed sync queue RPC calls
- **Files to Investigate**:
  - `/src/app/api/sync/route.ts` - Main sync logic
  - `/src/server/bidirectional-sync.js` - Bi-directional sync server
  - `/src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Local read status updates
  - Check PM2 logs for sync errors
- **Testing Plan**:
  1. Mark several articles as read
  2. Check sync_queue for entries
  3. Wait for bi-directional sync (5 min)
  4. Trigger manual sync
  5. Verify read status is preserved

### TODO-053: Investigate Article Freshness Perception Issue (P2 - Investigation)

- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Issue**: User perceives articles as being 5 hours old when latest is actually 3 hours old
- **Context**:
  - Investigation on July 24, 2025 at 4:07 AM EDT showed:
  - 2 AM sync ran successfully (completed at 6:00:06 UTC)
  - Latest article in DB is from 1:17 AM EDT (5:17 UTC)
  - This is ~3 hours old, not 5 hours as reported
  - Sync fetched 69 articles during 2 AM run
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. UI showing incorrect timestamps or timezone conversion issues
  2. Article list not sorting correctly by published date
  3. User looking at filtered view that excludes recent articles
  4. Client-side caching showing stale data
  5. Articles being marked as read automatically, hiding recent unread ones
- **Investigation Steps**:
  - [ ] Check how timestamps are displayed in the UI
  - [ ] Verify timezone handling in article list component
  - [ ] Check if any filters are hiding recent articles
  - [ ] Test article sorting logic
  - [ ] Verify client-side data freshness
- **Evidence Gathered**:
  - Database shows sync completed successfully at 2 AM EDT
  - 69 articles were synced at that time
  - Latest article is from 1:17 AM EDT (not 5 hours old)
  - Only 5 articles published in last 6 hours (RSS feeds quiet at night)
  - Sync is limited to 300 articles per run (SYNC_MAX_ARTICLES)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Identify why user sees older articles than what's in database
  - [ ] Fix any timezone display issues
  - [ ] Ensure article list shows most recent articles first
  - [ ] Verify filters aren't hiding recent content
  - [ ] Document findings and implement fix if needed

- **Completed**: July 22, 2025 - Technical debt resolved (re-applied with legacy-peer-deps)

### TODO-028: Enhance Back Button Navigation Logic (P2 - UX Enhancement) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Back button should always return to listing page instead of previous article
- **Current Behavior**: Back button uses browser history which may go to previous article when user has navigated through multiple articles using Previous/Next buttons
- **Expected Behavior**: Back button should consistently return to the article listing page, preserving filter state and scroll position
- **Use Case**: User navigates through multiple articles using UI Previous/Next buttons, then wants to return to the article list
- **Context**: Builds on scroll position preservation from TODO-009a
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Back button in article view always navigates to listing page (never to previous article)
  - [x] Preserve current feed filter when returning to listing
  - [x] Preserve current read status filter when returning to listing

### TODO-030: iOS Scroll-to-Top Gesture Support (P1 - Platform UX) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - July 22, 2025
- **Issue**: iOS native scroll-to-top gesture (tap status bar) and Safari URL bar collapse didn't work
- **Root Cause**: Safari requires document body to scroll, not inner containers
- **Solution**: Restructured layout to use natural document flow instead of constrained containers
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Changed layout from `h-screen` to `min-h-screen`
  - Removed all `overflow-y-auto` from inner containers
  - Made sidebar sticky instead of fixed height on desktop
  - Updated scroll tracking to use `window.scrollY`
  - Fixed hydration error with `useHydrationFix` hook for localStorage
  - Added `viewportFit: "cover"` to viewport configuration

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Changed to min-h-screen, sticky sidebar
  - `src/components/articles/article-list.tsx` - Removed scroll container
  - `src/components/articles/article-detail.tsx` - Removed scroll wrapper
  - `src/app/globals.css` - Cleaned up iOS scroll CSS
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added viewport-fit cover
  - `src/hooks/use-hydration-fix.ts` - Created for localStorage sync
  - `src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Fixed SSR localStorage access
- **Technical Notes**:
  - Safari only triggers scroll-to-top when document body scrolls
  - URL bar collapse also requires body-level scrolling
  - Perplexity confirmed this is a known Safari limitation
  - Solution follows Safari's expected behavior patterns

### TODO-037: Implement Bi-directional Sync to Inoreader (P1 - Core Feature)

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
- **Issue**: Read/unread status changes made in the app are not synced back to Inoreader
- **Current Behavior**: Sync is one-way only (Inoreader → Server → Supabase → Client)
- **Expected Behavior**: Changes made in the app should sync back to Inoreader
- **Context**: Architecture supports bi-directional sync but implementation was deferred
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ALL COMPLETED ✅
  - [x] Track all read/unread status changes in the app
  - [x] Implement offline queue for status changes
  - [x] Batch changes to minimize API calls
  - [x] Use `/edit-tag` endpoint to update Inoreader
  - [x] Handle conflicts (most recent change wins)
  - [x] Sync back changes during regular sync operations
  - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed sync attempts
  - [x] Display sync status for bi-directional operations
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create sync_queue table for tracking pending changes
  - Add timestamp to all read/unread actions
  - Batch updates during sync process (max 50 items per call)
  - Use Inoreader's `/edit-tag` API endpoint
  - Clear queue items after successful sync
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to track article Inoreader IDs for sync back
  - Consider rate limiting impact (100 calls/day limit)
  - Handle offline scenarios gracefully
  - Prevent sync loops (changes from Inoreader shouldn't trigger sync back)
- **API Endpoint**:
  ```
  POST https://www.inoreader.com/reader/api/0/edit-tag
  Parameters:
  - a: Article ID (Inoreader format)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (to mark as read)
  - r: user/-/state/com.google/read (with param r=user/-/state/com.google/read to mark as unread)
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Complete synchronization across all devices
  - Changes persist in Inoreader ecosystem
  - Better integration with other Inoreader clients
  - Reduced confusion about read state
- **Completed**: July 23, 2025 - Feature fully implemented and verified working. The only issue was the sync server wasn't running in production. Once started, all functionality worked as designed with efficient batching and proper error handling.

### TODO-038: Fix Client-Side Sync Queue RPC Calls (P2 - Bug) ✅ COMPLETED

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - SQL function syntax error fixed
- **Issue**: Client-side article store failed to add entries to sync_queue via RPC
- **Root Cause**: SQL syntax error in add_to_sync_queue function - CASE statement with arrays
- **Solution**: Fixed function to use IF/ELSIF instead of CASE with arrays
- **Completed**: January 22, 2025
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/lib/stores/article-store.ts` - Added error handling to RPC calls
  - `/src/lib/db/migrations/008_fix_sync_queue_function.sql` - Fixed function syntax
- **Verification**: Tested with Playwright - sync queue now properly records read/star actions

### TODO-041: Fix Cron Sync URL Missing /reader Prefix (P0 - Critical Bug)

- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Automatic sync has been failing since deployment because cron service calls wrong URL
- **Root Cause**: Cron service configured to call `http://localhost:3147/api/sync` but app uses `/reader` basePath
- **Evidence**:
  - All automatic syncs failing with "fetch failed" or "404" errors since July 22
  - Manual test confirms `/api/sync` returns 404, but `/reader/api/sync` works correctly
  - Logs show consistent failures at 2:00 AM and 2:00 PM daily
- **Current Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  // ecosystem.config.js line 91
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3147"; // Missing /reader prefix
  ```
- **Fix Applied**: Updated ecosystem.config.js to use environment variable with correct default:
  ```javascript
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL ||
    "http://localhost:3147/reader";
  ```
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Update ecosystem.config.js to use correct URL with /reader prefix
  - [x] Use environment variable instead of hardcoding URL
  - [x] Test manual sync via cron service succeeds - Tested at 2:35 AM
  - [x] Verify automatic sync runs successfully at next scheduled time - Completed in 4.4 seconds
  - [ ] Update deployment documentation if needed
- **Impact**: HIGH - No automatic syncs have been running in production
- **Discovered**: July 23, 2025 at 2:19 AM EDT (just after failed 2:00 AM sync)
- **Fixed**: July 23, 2025 - Applied environment variable approach with correct /reader prefix
