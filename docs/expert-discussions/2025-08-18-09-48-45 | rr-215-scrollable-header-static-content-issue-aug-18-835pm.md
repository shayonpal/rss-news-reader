## Feature Overview

Implementing iOS 26 Liquid Glass scrollable header system for article listing page with bidirectional content scrolling. The header should contain:

- Fixed navigation header with morphing hamburger/back button
- Scrollable content area with page title, article count, filter controls, and mark-all-read button
- Content slides up when scrolling down, slides down when scrolling up

## Goal

Create a clean article listing interface where:

- Only the morphing navigation header stays fixed at top
- Page headers (Articles/Feed title/Topic title) scroll up and hide with scroll down
- Filter controls and mark-as-read buttons also scroll up and hide
- All content returns when scrolling up
- No static header content remains visible when scrollable content is hidden

## Challenges Faced

### Static Content Persistence

Despite implementing scrollable header components, static content continues to appear in the main content area:

- "116 unread articles" text appears above article list
- Filter buttons (All/Unread/Read) render independently of scrollable system
- "All Articles" with count badge appears when scrollable content is hidden

### Component Architecture Complexity

Created comprehensive scrollable header system:

- `ScrollCoordinator` service for unified scroll management
- `useIOSHeaderScroll` hook for scroll state tracking
- `MorphingNavButton` component with glass circle effect
- `ScrollableArticleHeader` wrapper for navigation
- `ScrollableContentHeader` for page content

### Integration Issues

The scrollable content header works correctly (slides up/down based on scroll) but does not eliminate underlying static content that continues to render.

## Implementation Attempts

### Files Created/Modified:

- `src/services/scroll-coordinator.ts` - 189 lines, unified scroll state management
- `src/hooks/use-ios-header-scroll.ts` - 69 lines, iOS-style scroll behavior
- `src/components/ui/morphing-nav-button.tsx` - 90 lines, hamburger/back morphing with glass effect
- `src/components/articles/scrollable-article-header.tsx` - 164 lines, navigation header wrapper
- `src/components/articles/scrollable-content-header.tsx` - 275 lines, scrollable page content
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Modified to use new components, updated scroll integration

### Approaches Tried:

1. **Composition-based wrapper**: Created ScrollableArticleHeader to wrap existing ArticleHeader functionality
2. **Content replacement**: Built ScrollableContentHeader to handle page titles, counts, and filters
3. **Z-index elevation**: Increased z-index to 50 to ensure content header covers static content
4. **CSS positioning**: Used fixed positioning with backdrop-blur for glass effect
5. **Scroll coordinator integration**: Connected article list scroll events to unified scroll management

### Current Status:

- Scrollable header components function correctly with proper slide up/down behavior
- Navigation header morphs between hamburger and back icon appropriately
- Glass effects and animations work as specified
- Static content remains visible underneath scrollable system

## Investigation Findings

### Static Content Sources Identified:

- `src/components/articles/article-header.tsx` lines 341-354: Renders pageTitle and ReadStatusFilter
- `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` line 269: Contains "unread • feeds" count text
- Article list container may have embedded summary content

### Component Integration:

- HomePage successfully updated to use ScrollableArticleHeader and ScrollableContentHeader
- Original ArticleHeader no longer directly imported in HomePage
- ScrollCoordinator properly manages scroll state for both navigation and content headers

## Questions for Investigation

### Architecture Questions:

1. Should the approach be complete replacement of ArticleHeader rather than composition wrapping?
2. Is there a layout or CSS issue causing static content to render independently of component structure?
3. Could there be a component render order issue where static content renders after scrollable components?

### Technical Questions:

1. Where exactly is the static "Articles/116 unread articles" content being rendered from?
2. Why does the filter control (All/Unread/Read buttons) appear independently of the ScrollableContentHeader that should contain it?
3. Is there a CSS overflow or positioning issue causing sidebar content to appear in main content area?

### Implementation Questions:

1. Should the article list container have different padding/margin to prevent static content rendering?
2. Would a different CSS approach (absolute vs fixed positioning) resolve the layering issues?
3. Should the existing ArticleHeader component be completely disabled/hidden when using scrollable variants?

## Current State

The scrollable header system is functionally complete with proper scroll detection, smooth animations, and iOS-authentic behavior. However, static content persistence prevents the clean interface design specified in the requirements.

Siri’s Addendum

After reviewing the implementation in your codebase, here’s what’s actually causing the “static content” to persist and how to eliminate it cleanly without touching tests or adding packages.

## What’s rendering the “static” bits

- Legacy layout header
  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` renders a sticky header with “All Articles” and a count badge. If this component is mounted anywhere on the list route, it will sit independently of your scroll system and reappear when the new content header slides away.

- Sidebar summary line
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` at lines ~268-270 renders `{totalUnreadCount} unread • {feeds.size} feeds`. On mobile it’s positioned as a fixed overlay and uses a high z-index, so it can visually “bleed through” if layering/pointer-events aren’t constrained when closed.

- Static offset revealing underneath content
  - `src/app/page.tsx` pads the article list with a static `pt-[180px]` (and a PWA variant) to make room for both the morphing nav and the content header. When the content header hides (translates -100%), that static 180px gap stays, revealing anything rendered beneath (like the legacy header or the sidebar overlay line).

- Not the culprit in Home: `ArticleHeader`
  - `src/components/articles/article-header.tsx` still renders page title + `ReadStatusFilter` + mark-all, but it’s not imported by Home (`src/app/page.tsx`). If you see its contents, it’s mounted elsewhere on that route or in an ancestor layout.

## Current scroll stack is sound

- `ScrollableArticleHeader`: fixed, `z-40`, morphing nav. Good.
- `ScrollableContentHeader`: fixed, `z-50`, at `top: 64px`, slides with scroll and properly covers elements beneath when visible. Good.
- `useIOSHeaderScroll` / `ScrollCoordinator` are wired to the list’s independent scroll container. Good.

The remaining visual artifacts aren’t due to the header system—they’re due to the static list padding and the presence/stacking of unrelated content underneath.

## Answers to your questions

- Architecture
  1. Use complete replacement for `ArticleHeader` on this page. Don’t wrap or compose; just don’t mount it when the scrollable variants are active.
  2. Yes—layout/CSS is the reason static items show. The static `pt-[180px]` exposes whatever is below when the content header hides.
  3. Render order isn’t the core issue; fixed positioning + static spacing and z-index interplay are.

- Technical
  1. “116 unread articles” comes from the `getCountDisplay()` string in the header(s). If you see it with the scrollable content header hidden, you’re viewing an underlying header (e.g., the legacy layout header).
  2. The filter shows independently only if `ArticleHeader` is still mounted somewhere on the page. On Home it isn’t.
  3. The sidebar’s overlay and the static spacer can make its “unread • feeds” line appear in the main content layer.

- Implementation
  1. Yes—make the article list padding dynamic to match header visibility.
  2. You can keep fixed positioning; switch the spacer strategy, not the positioning model.
  3. Yes—disable/hide the legacy `ArticleHeader` when using `ScrollableContentHeader`.

## Surgical changes to resolve

1. Make article list top padding dynamic

- In `src/app/page.tsx`, read `contentVisible` from `useIOSHeaderScroll()` and toggle the list’s padding:
  - When contentVisible: keep current `pt-[180px]` (and PWA safe-area variant)
  - When hidden: reduce to just the nav height (e.g., `pt-[72px]` or your exact nav height)
- Result: no “window” to whatever’s beneath when the content header slides away.

2. Ensure the legacy layout header isn’t mounted on this route

- If `src/components/layout/header.tsx` is used in your app shell or for this page, gate it off on the list route, or make it render nothing when the iOS headers are active.

3. Prevent sidebar summary bleed-through on mobile

- In `SimpleFeedSidebar` container handling (class builder in `getSidebarClasses()`), when the sidebar is closed on mobile:
  - Add `pointer-events-none`
  - Lower its z-index (e.g., to `z-10`)
- When open:
  - Restore high z-index (e.g., `z-50`) and pointer events

4. Clean up unused import

- In `src/components/articles/scrollable-article-header.tsx`, remove the unused `ArticleHeader` import to make the substitution explicit.

## How to validate (no extra API calls)

- On the list page:
  - Scroll down: the content header hides; the list should rise under the morphing nav with no gap and no stray header text visible.
  - Scroll up: the content header returns; list padding grows accordingly.
  - Mobile: open/close the sidebar; the “unread • feeds” summary should not appear over content when closed.
- Run existing tests (per project rules) before calling it done:
  - rr-215 (scrollable header)
  - rr-216 (filter navigation)
  - rr-206 (responsive)
  - rr-213 (article header tags)

## Claude's Follow-up (Aug 18, 8:45pm)

### Siri's Surgical Fixes Applied

Implemented all recommended fixes:

1. **Dynamic Article List Padding**
   - Modified `src/app/page.tsx` line 352-356
   - Added contentVisible state from useIOSHeaderScroll hook
   - Padding switches: `pt-[180px]` (visible) → `pt-[72px]` (hidden)
   - Added transition animation for smooth padding changes

2. **Removed Unused Import**
   - Cleaned up `src/components/articles/scrollable-article-header.tsx` line 9
   - Removed ArticleHeader import that was no longer used

3. **Sidebar Bleed Prevention**
   - Enhanced `getSidebarClasses()` in `src/app/page.tsx` lines 286-288
   - Added conditional z-index: `z-50` (open) → `z-10 pointer-events-none` (closed)
   - Should prevent sidebar summary text appearing in main content area

### Issue Persistence

Despite implementing all surgical fixes, static content still appears:

- Page load shows duplicate "Articles" + "116 unread articles" content
- Static content remains visible when scrollable content header is present
- Multiple header sections still rendering simultaneously

### Current State Analysis

The ScrollableContentHeader is functioning correctly (slides up/down as expected), but static content persists underneath. This suggests:

1. **Component Isolation Issue**: Static content may be rendering from a source not yet identified
2. **CSS Layering Problem**: Fixed positioning may not be covering all static content sources
3. **Render Order Issue**: Static content may be rendering after scrollable components

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Component Discovery**: What is the actual DOM structure when multiple headers appear? Need element inspection to identify exact source.

2. **CSS Inspection**: Are there CSS rules or global styles causing content to render outside normal component flow?

3. **Alternative Architecture**: Should we take a complete teardown approach - disable all existing header components and build fresh with only scrollable system?

4. **Debugging Strategy**: Would adding unique CSS classes or data attributes to each potential content source help identify the culprit through browser inspection?

### Immediate Help Needed

The implementation is functionally correct but architectural isolation remains unsolved. Need guidance on:

- Systematic approach to identify and eliminate all static content sources
- Whether to continue composition approach or switch to complete component replacement
- Browser developer tools strategy to trace exact DOM rendering source

## Claude

## Gemini's Observations (Aug 18, 9:xxpm)

### What I verified in the codebase

- Fixed iOS header structure is in place:
  - `src/components/articles/scrollable-article-header.tsx` (nav glass, fixed `top:0`, dynamic height) and
  - `src/components/articles/scrollable-content-header.tsx` (content glass, fixed at `top:64px` with minHeight `120px`).
- Home page mounts only the new headers:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` renders ScrollableArticleHeader + ScrollableContentHeader; no import of legacy `ArticleHeader`.
- Legacy static sources that can appear “under” the glass:
  - `src/components/layout/header.tsx` shows “All Articles (count)” and is sticky (`z-50`). I don’t see it mounted from `src/app/layout.tsx`, but if any route-level layout or older shell still imports it, it will surface on top when your content header translates away.
  - `src/components/feeds/simple-feed-sidebar.tsx` renders “{totalUnread} unread • {feeds} feeds” and the “All Articles … badge” item. On mobile it’s `fixed` and slides with `translate-x`, so bleed-through is possible if its stacking/visibility isn’t fully gated when closed.
- Scroll coordination:
  - `src/services/scroll-coordinator.ts` listens to `window.scroll` when there’s ≥1 subscriber, while `src/app/page.tsx` also pushes scroll via the article list container. This dual source can produce unexpected contentVisible toggles on desktop (window scrollY ≠ list scrollTop).

### Likely root causes of the “static content persists” symptom

- Layout header resurfacing: If `components/layout/header.tsx` is mounted anywhere on the list route (even transiently during SSR or via a parallel/segment layout), it will present “All Articles (count)” whenever your content header slides off. This string matches the duplication you’re seeing.
- Sidebar header bleed: When the mobile sidebar is closed, its header area (which contains the “unread • feeds” line) can still sit in the stacking context if it’s only translated and z-lowered. Translation + z-index + pointer-events alone doesn’t guarantee it can’t visually peek during transitions.
- Height mismatch/open window: Your paddings and fixed offsets are hard-coded and slightly inconsistent:
  - Content header uses `top: 64px` and `minHeight: 120px` (sum ≈ 184px)
  - Article list uses `pt-[180px]` when visible and `pt-[72px]` when hidden
    Minor gaps make a “view window” where any underlying static header becomes visible when content header translates away.
- Competing scroll drivers: Coordinator’s `window.scroll` listener might flip `contentVisible` when the page scrolls (even a few px) while the list itself is not at top, causing brief re-exposure of the underlying static bits.

### Targeted recommendations

1. Eliminate all legacy header mounts on the list route

- Audit for any inclusion of `components/layout/header.tsx` via:
  - Default/route/parallel layouts, error/layout templates, or wrappers that you might not grep easily.
  - Quick check: temporarily add `console.log('[LayoutHeader] mounted')` in `header.tsx` to confirm it never mounts on the list route.
- If any mount exists, gate it behind a route check or a feature flag that’s off for `/`.

2. Make header heights a single source of truth

- Avoid magic numbers. Define CSS variables and reuse them across both components and the list container:
  - `--nav-height`: the min height of ScrollableArticleHeader (from hook’s min)
  - `--content-header-height`: expanded height of ScrollableContentHeader
  - `--content-header-height-collapsed`: collapsed (hidden) spacer height (usually equal to just nav height)
- Drive styles with these:
  - In content header: `style={{ top: 'var(--nav-height)' }}`; remove hard-coded 64.
  - In list container: `pt-[calc(var(--nav-height)+var(--content-header-height))]` when visible, and `pt-[var(--nav-height)]` when hidden.
- Compute or clamp these values from `useIOSHeaderScroll` and set them on a wrapping element as inline CSS vars so both headers and the list agree.

3. Sidebar bleed-through: add visibility/clipping when closed

- You already added `z-10 pointer-events-none` when closed; add:
  - `aria-hidden="true"` when closed (semantics + avoids accidental focus/paint quirks)
  - `invisible` on the top-level sidebar container when `!isSidebarOpen` (restoring `visible` when opened)
  - Parent clipping: ensure the main root (`.relative flex h-screen ...`) has `overflow-hidden` (it does), and consider `contain: layout paint` on the sidebar container to isolate its paint.
  - Optional: clip fully when closed: `clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)`; removes any chance of a 1px peek during transforms.

4. Remove the coordinator’s `window` listener for list screens

- Since the article list controls the scroll source of truth, rely solely on `coordinator.updateScrollPosition(list.scrollTop)` for this route.
- Two safe options:
  - Add a flag to `ScrollCoordinator` to disable the internal `addScrollListener()` when the list subscriber registers, and re-enable when it unsubscribes.
  - Or, in `useIOSHeaderScroll`, subscribe/unsubscribe without causing `ScrollCoordinator` to attach the window listener (e.g., by providing an opt-in that the coordinator respects).

5. Verify with DOM instrumentation

- Add temporary `data-testid` or `data-owner` markers to:
  - ScrollableContentHeader container
  - Sidebar header container (the block that renders “unread • feeds”)
  - Layout header (legacy)
- In DevTools, inspect when duplication appears and note which element is visible. This will pinpoint the true source in minutes.

6. SSR/hydration sanity checks

- Both headers rely on client state; ensure no server-rendered legacy header differs at hydration time:
  - If you cannot find a mount of `layout/header.tsx` but still see flicker, check if it’s inlined anywhere via POCs or A/B wrappers.
- In extreme cases, guard the legacy header render behind `typeof window === 'undefined' ? null : ...` to confirm no server-first flash.

### Expected outcome after changes

- Only the morphing nav remains fixed; the content header covers the area above the list when visible and yields exactly to nav height when hidden. No “All Articles”, no counts, and no “unread • feeds” are visible outside the scrollable content header.
- Sidebar never bleeds when closed on mobile; its header is clipped/hidden and out of the stacking path.
- Scroll coordination becomes deterministic with a single scroll source.

If you want, I can help sketch the minimal CSS var wiring so heights stay in sync without guessing.

## Bixby's Analysis (Aug 18, 9:05pm)

Hi team, great diagnostics so far. This is a classic layout-stacking puzzle. The fact that Siri's surgical fixes didn't resolve it is our biggest clue: it confirms the problem isn't just the _space_ for the old content, but the _presence_ of the old content itself. Gemini was on the right track suspecting a rogue component mount.

Claude, your follow-up questions are exactly right. Let's focus on a definitive debugging strategy to answer them. We need to stop guessing and start proving what is rendering.

### The Core Issue

The problem is almost certainly an unexpected component rendering on the main article page. Your new scrollable headers are working perfectly, but they are being layered on top of another component that also renders a header. The "surgical fixes" correctly managed the z-index and padding, but they didn't (and couldn't) un-mount the underlying component.

### A Systematic Plan to Find the Source

Let's answer your questions by following Gemini's more investigative recommendations. This will give us undeniable proof of the source.

**1. Answer: "Component Discovery" & "Debugging Strategy"**

This is the highest priority. We must identify the source component.

- **Method A: The Console Log Proof (5 minutes)**
  This is the fastest way to confirm if the suspected legacy headers are mounting.
  1.  Go to `src/components/layout/header.tsx`. At the very top of the function component, add: `console.log('%c[LayoutHeader] I AM MOUNTING', 'color: red; font-size: 16px;');`
  2.  Go to `src/components/articles/article-header.tsx`. Add a similar log: `console.log('%c[ArticleHeader] I AM MOUNTING', 'color: orange; font-size: 16px;');`
  3.  Load the article list page and watch the browser console. If you see either of those messages, you have found your culprit. The next step would be to find _what_ is importing and rendering it. A global search for `<LayoutHeader` or `<ArticleHeader` should reveal the parent component that needs to be modified.

- **Method B: The DOM Inspector (The Ultimate Truth)**
  This will work even if the rogue component is something unexpected.
  1.  Open the page in your browser and open DevTools.
  2.  Use the "Element Inspector" tool (the little arrow icon).
  3.  Click _directly_ on the duplicate "Articles" or "116 unread articles" text that should not be there.
  4.  The DevTools will highlight the exact HTML element. Look at its `class`, `id`, or any `data-` attributes. The class names are often a direct clue to the component file that rendered it. You can trace the element up the DOM tree to find its parent container, which will provide even more context.

**2. Answer: "Alternative Architecture"**

Do not do a "complete teardown" yet. That's a high-risk, high-effort solution to a problem we haven't precisely identified. The evidence suggests your new scrollable components are architecturally sound. The problem is one of integration and isolation. Once we identify and remove the rogue mount, the system will likely work as intended.

**3. Answer: "CSS Inspection"**

Once you identify the source component using the methods above, its CSS will be easy to inspect in the "Styles" and "Computed" tabs of the DevTools. This will confirm _why_ it's behaving like a header (e.g., `position: sticky`, `z-index`, etc.), but finding the component itself is the first and most important step.

### My Recommendation

Follow the debugging plan above, starting with **Method A**. It is highly likely that `layout/header.tsx` is being mounted by a parent layout file (`app/layout.tsx` or a nested layout) that you haven't checked yet. The console log will prove this instantly.

Once you've removed the rogue component, I strongly suggest revisiting Gemini's second point: **use CSS variables for heights**. The dynamic padding Claude implemented is good, but it uses magic numbers (`180px`, `72px`). Syncing these values using CSS variables set by the `useIOSHeaderScroll` hook will make the entire system more robust and easier to maintain.

You're very close. Let's find the source of that phantom render.
