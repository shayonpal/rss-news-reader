# RR-162: Auto-Fetch Functionality Removal

**Completed**: 2025-08-13
**Issue**: RR-162 - Remove auto-fetch functionality to fix sync hanging at 92%
**Type**: Breaking Change

## Overview
Removed the `autoFetchFullContent` feature that was causing sync to hang at 92%. This was an unused feature that added complexity without providing value, as users prefer manual control over content fetching.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type System Updates
- **src/types/index.ts**: Removed `autoFetchFullContent: boolean` field from `UserPreferences` interface (line 108)

### 2. Repository Updates
- **src/lib/db/repositories/user-preferences-repository.ts**:
  - Removed field from `newPreferences` object creation (line 60)
  - Removed field from `defaultPreferences` in `resetToDefaults()` (lines 85-86)

### 3. Database Migrations
- **src/lib/db/migrations.ts**: Removed field from `defaultPreferences` (line 305)

### 4. API Endpoint Updates
- **src/app/api/health/parsing/route.ts**:
  - Removed auto-fetch statistics tracking
  - Simplified `fetchStats` to only track manual fetches
  - Removed `auto` property and related logic

### 5. Documentation Updates
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added breaking change entry
- **docs/api/server-endpoints.md**: Updated 3 endpoint descriptions
- **docs/product/PRD.md**: Replaced auto-fetch section with manual-only approach
- **README.md**: Updated feature list

## Test Coverage
Existing tests for RR-162 already in place:
- `tests/db/user-preferences.test.ts`
- `tests/api/sync.test.ts`
- `tests/components/settings/preferences.test.tsx`
- `tests/lib/sync/sync-manager.test.ts`
- `tests/app/reader/settings/preferences.test.tsx`

## Impact
- **Breaking Change**: Applications relying on `autoFetchFullContent` field will need updates
- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary preference processing overhead
- **Sync Reliability**: Fixes the 92% hanging issue
- **User Experience**: Simplifies to manual-only content fetching

## Verification Completed
- All production references removed (verified with Serena search)
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Linting passes
- Build succeeds
- Manual verification completed by user

## Related Files Not Modified
These files contain historical references or test contracts that should remain:
- Test files with RR-162 contracts
- Release notes with historical context
- Migration test files

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for any user feedback about missing auto-fetch
- Consider implementing a queue-based manual fetch system if needed
- Keep fetch_logs infrastructure for manual fetch tracking
