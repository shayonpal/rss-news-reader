# Move out complete todos to docs/shipped-todos.md

Identify all tasks in docs/TODOs.md that have been completely done, reference with @CHANGELOG.md and past commits if needed and then:

1. Move the completed tasks to docs/shipped-todos.md. There shouldn't be any more completed TODOs left in docs/TODOs.md. Also ensure there are no duplicate TODOs this docs/shipped-todos.md.
2. Leave all incomplete, in progress and untouched tasks in docs/TODOs.md

After I verify your work, commit the changes and push to the current branch.
