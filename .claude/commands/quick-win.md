# Get top 5 'quick win' tasks

Use the `doc-admin` agent to check docs/shipped-todo.md for features already shipped, docs/TODOs.md for pending tasks and identify top 5 tasks that could be quick wins for us. In this analysis, don't consider the priorities mentioned within the tasks themselves, use your own understanding.

If you feel the need to refer to any other documentations in docs/ directory, ask `doc-admin`.

This is a `read-only` exercise. We'll start building only after we're done with the planning.
