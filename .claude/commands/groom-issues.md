description: Groom Linear Issues
---

Use the `liear-expert` agent to:

1. Look into all the incomplete issues, sub-issues, and comments
2. Analyze if they are still valid.
3. Look for:
   3.1. Potential duplicates
   3.2. Potential refactoring opportunities
   3.3. Potential order of execution

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Ignore priorities mentioned in the issues themselves for this analysis.
2. Think hard and be pragmatic about the issues. Use your own judgement and experience to determine the best course of action.
3. Ensure you've read through README.md and CHANGELOG.md to get a good understanding of the project.
4. Also ask `git-expert` to provide a summary of the past 5-10 commits to get a good understanding of the project.
