# Analyze Linear Issue or Explore Ideas

Analyze the Linear issue or idea provided in $ARGUMENTS and prepare an implementation plan or feasibility assessment.

This is a `read-only` mode discussion session. No files will be written during analysis.

## 1. Parse Input

Check $ARGUMENTS:
- If starts with "RR-" or just a number ‚Üí Linear issue analysis (continue to step 2A)
- If Linear URL, then it could be a Project. List oll projects, surmise the project ID and read the project description and issues within it
- If any other text ‚Üí Idea exploration (go to step 2B)
- If empty ‚Üí Error: "Please provide a Linear issue ID (e.g., RR-123) or describe an idea to explore"

## 2A. Linear Issue Analysis

If Linear issue ID provided:

1. **Fetch Issue Details**:
   - Use `linear-expert` to get full issue with ALL comments and sub-issues (if they exist)
   - Extract description, labels, priority, dependencies
   - Remember: Issue + comments = living specification

2. **Check Related Context**:
   - Parent/child issues
   - Blocking/blocked by relationships
   - Related completed issues for patterns

3. **Update Status**:
   - Use `linear-expert` to move to "In Progress" if needed
   - Add analysis start comment with timestamp

Then continue to step 3.

## 2B. Idea Exploration

If idea description provided:

1. **Capture the Idea**:
   - Parse the description for key concepts
   - Identify what problem it might solve
   - Consider how it fits with existing features

2. **Stay Read-Only**:
   - DO NOT create Linear issue yet
   - DO NOT modify any code
   - Focus on feasibility analysis

Then continue to step 3.

## 3. Technical Analysis

Use read-only agents to gather comprehensive context:

### Core Context Gathering:
- Use `doc-search` for project documentation
- Use `db-expert-readonly` for database schema analysis
- Use `devops-expert-readonly` for infrastructure context

### Pattern Analysis:
- Similar features already implemented
- Established coding patterns
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements

## 3.5 Pragmatic Analysis Approach

**Important**: During analysis, provide honest technical assessment:

- **Challenge assumptions**: Question if the idea truly solves the stated problem
- **Consider alternatives**: "Have you considered X instead?"
- **Identify risks**: "This might cause Y issue because..."
- **Be direct**: "This won't work because..." with clear reasoning
- **Suggest improvements**: "What if we modified it to..."
- **Consider effort vs value**: "Is this worth 3 days for 2% improvement?"

This is a collaborative discussion to find the best solution.

## 4. Implementation Planning

Based on issue type:

### For Bugs:
1. Identify affected components
2. Locate likely source files
3. Suggest debugging approach
4. List test scenarios

### For Features:
1. Break down into sub-tasks
2. Identify dependencies
3. Suggest implementation order
4. Define acceptance criteria

### For Enhancements:
1. Find current implementation
2. Assess impact radius
3. Suggest incremental approach
4. Consider backward compatibility

## 5. Dependency Analysis

Use read-only agents to check:
- **Database changes?** ‚Üí `db-expert-readonly` for schema impact
- **Sync logic changes?** ‚Üí `devops-expert-readonly` for sync analysis
- **Infrastructure changes?** ‚Üí `devops-expert-readonly` for deployment impact

## 6. Test Planning

Draft:
- Test scenarios based on requirements
- Edge cases to consider
- Test data needs
- Integration test approach

## 7. Implementation Strategy Presentation

Present findings in PM-friendly language:

```
üìã Analysis for RR-XXX: [Title]

üìù Summary:
[2-3 sentences explaining the task]

üéØ Implementation Strategy:
1. [Step 1 - what and why]
2. [Step 2 - what and why]
3. [Step 3 - what and why]

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:
- [Technical constraint or risk]
- [Dependency or coordination need]

‚è±Ô∏è Estimate: [X hours/days]

‚ùì Questions:
- [Any clarification needed]
```

## 8. Interactive Strategy Refinement

After presenting the implementation strategy, ask:

```
Do you:
1. ‚úÖ Agree with this implementation strategy?
2. üîÑ Want to continue evolving it?
3. üîç Want a domain expert to review it?

Please respond with 1, 2, or 3.
```

### If I choose 2 (Continue evolving):
- Ask for specific concerns or areas to refine
- Iterate on the strategy based on feedback
- Present revised strategy
- Return to the options (1, 2, or 3) until I agree

### If I choose 3 (Domain expert review):
- Ask: "Which domain expert should review this? (e.g., db-expert, devops-expert, ui-expert)"
- Based on the response, use the appropriate expert agent to review the implementation strategy
- The expert should provide:
  - Technical validation of the approach
  - Potential issues or concerns
  - Optimization suggestions
  - Best practices relevant to their domain
- Present the expert's feedback
- Return to the options (1, 2, or 3) with the expert insights incorporated

### If I choose 1 (Agree):
Proceed to step 9 for finalization.

## 9. Finalize Implementation Strategy

Once I agree with the implementation strategy:

### 9A. Update Linear Issue with Implementation Strategy

Use `linear-expert` to:
1. Add the agreed implementation strategy as a comment on the issue
2. Format the comment clearly with:
   - "**Implementation Strategy (Approved)**"
   - The full strategy details
   - Timestamp of approval

### 9B. Generate Test Cases

Use `test-expert` agent with:
1. The full Linear issue details (title, description, comments)
2. The agreed implementation strategy
3. Request comprehensive test cases including:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Edge cases
   - Acceptance criteria verification

### 9C. Update Linear Issue with Test Cases

Use `linear-expert` to:
1. Add test cases as a separate comment on the issue
2. Format the comment with:
   - "**Test Cases**"
   - Structured list of all test scenarios
   - Clear pass/fail criteria

## 10. Final Summary Report

Present a summary of what was accomplished:

```
‚úÖ Analysis Complete for RR-XXX

üìù Actions Taken:
1. ‚úÖ Implementation strategy agreed and documented
2. ‚úÖ Test cases generated by test-expert
3. ‚úÖ Linear issue updated with both strategy and test cases

üìã Next Steps:
- Use /execute RR-XXX to begin implementation
- All test cases are documented in the issue
- Implementation strategy is approved and ready

üîó Linear Issue: [Link to issue]
```

## 11. Idea Evaluation (for non-issue analysis)

If this was idea exploration (not a Linear issue):

"This idea looks [promising/challenging/interesting]. Would you like me to create a Linear issue for it?"

If yes:
- Use `linear-expert` to create issue
- Use the analysis findings for description
- Apply appropriate labels
- Return new issue ID

## Important Notes

- üö´ NO file operations during analysis
- Use read-only agent variants (db-expert-readonly, devops-expert-readonly, doc-search)
- Synthesize all analysis from agent data
- No "waiting for approval" - analysis is complete when presented
- Implementation requires explicit /execute command
