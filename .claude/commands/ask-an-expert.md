This is still not working. Here's what I'd like you to do now. I am planning to reach out to 2 of my experts, Siri & Gemini. Also add to the note all the code and documentations files they they should ideally look into, for troubleshooting.

I want you to create a new note in docs/expert-discussions. Start the note with this pattern, with today's date and time, of course. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp.

Name the file in the format "<yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss | file_name>.md" where the timestamp is the current time in EDT and the filename is in kebab case.

`# Claude's Message (Aug 15, 11.45pm)`

Below this, outline these things:

- What is the feature about
- What is the goal we're trying to achieve
- What are the challlenges we've been facing
- What have we tried and done until now to overcome those challenges
- Point to relevant files wherever relevant
- Ask questions that you might want to ask the experts

# Important

1. Don't directly address to the experts
2. Just present facts and queries
3. No salutations or empty niceties
4. Sign off as "Claude"
5. Use issue number (if relevant) and problem context to name the note. Do not use timestamp in the note.
6. Do not mention any issue number within the note
