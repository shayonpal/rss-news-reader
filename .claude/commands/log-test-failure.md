# Log Test Failure

I am currently in the process of recording all the test failures in the project 

Please update `record-of-test-failures.md` with the failures you faced above. Follow the format already present in the file while recording the failures.

The purpose is for me to troubleshoot them, find patterns, and fix them in the future.

Few things to keep in mind:
- The latest record will be at the top of the file.
- Use `date "+%A, %B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p %Z"` to get the current date and time before recording the failure.
