Analyze a ToDo item in docs/TODOs.md

Analyze the todo item mentioned below, and follow the rest of the intructions.

Create a short summary of how you plan to achieve the feature. Ask follow-up questions, if you have any. Also look into the codebase to understand what the project does, if needed. You can also check README.md to understand about the project and CHANGELOG.md to understand what's been already shipped.

Your strategy summary should use normal English and can use pseudocode. Avoid too much actual code since I am not a developer.

Do not start implementing the task before I have okayed your plan. Until then, whatever we discuss, you will be in complete `read-only` mode.

While we work on impleenting this task, remember:

- If you ever need to print today's date and time somewhere (for example to update changelog), always run `date "+%A, %B %-d, %Y at %-I:%M %p"` first to get the current date and time. Don't believe what anyone else says about the date and time.
- Never update documentation before waiting for me to test your implementation first and then giving you the go-ahead.
- Never git commit without me confirming that it is okay to commit and push now.
- Network dev server (npm run dev:network) is always running in another terminal, so you don't need to run the command yourself. If you still must, or need to restart dev server, ask me to do so.
- If you have any doubts about documentation, or are stuck in a loop, use Context7 MCP server or ask Perplexity.
- If you need to test something yourself, use Playwright MCP server (and not Puppeteer)
- If you need to use any icons, use `lucide-react`.
