# Flow Prepare - Vertical Slice Preparation Phase

Complete preparation and test planning that delivers a fully tested specification ready for implementation. This command follows vertical slicing principles where each phase delivers complete, standalone value.

**Vertical Slicing Principle**: Each command represents a complete slice of value delivery. Flow-prepare delivers a fully-specified, test-verified implementation plan that could be handed to any developer for execution.

## Help Mode

If user provides `--help` or `help` parameter, display this usage guide instead of running the command:

```
flow-prepare - Complete preparation and test planning phase

USAGE:
  flow-prepare #123           Prepare implementation for GitHub issue
  flow-prepare "description"  Prepare new feature with issue creation
  flow-prepare                Interactive preparation mode
  flow-prepare help           Show this help

DELIVERABLES:
  ‚úÖ Requirements analysis and acceptance criteria
  ‚úÖ Implementation plan with task breakdown
  ‚úÖ Test specifications written and verified
  ‚úÖ API documentation (if applicable)
  ‚úÖ Ready-to-implement specification

EXAMPLES:
  flow-prepare #67
  flow-prepare "add user preferences API"
  flow-prepare
```

## Usage Modes

### 1. Issue Mode (with issue number)

`flow-prepare #123` - Prepare implementation for a specific GitHub issue

### 2. Feature Mode (with description)

`flow-prepare "add dark mode"` - Create issue and prepare complete specification

### 3. Interactive Mode (no parameters)

`flow-prepare` - Interactive preparation with user guidance

## Instructions

**CRITICAL: Always activate Serena MCP at session start:**

```bash
# Activate Serena MCP for project context and symbol navigation
mcp__serena__activate_project
```

**First, check if user needs guidance:**

- If no parameters provided, show preparation options and ask what they want to do
- If `help` or `--help` provided, show the help mode above and stop
- Otherwise proceed with mode detection and preparation

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis

1. **Determine Mode and Context**
   - If input contains `#\d+`, use Issue Mode
   - If input contains quoted text, use Feature Mode
   - Otherwise, use Interactive Mode

2. **Issue Mode Steps**

   ```bash
   # Fetch complete issue context
   gh issue view <number> --comments --json title,body,assignees,labels,state

   # Update issue status to in-progress
   gh issue edit <number> --add-label "in-progress" --add-label "preparing"

   # Post preparation start comment
   gh issue comment <number> --body "üîç **Preparation Phase Started**\n\nAnalyzing requirements and creating implementation specification..."
   ```

3. **Feature Mode Steps**
   - Create GitHub issue with detailed description
   - Set appropriate labels (enhancement, feature)
   - Continue with created issue number

4. **Interactive Mode Steps**
   - Ask user to describe what they want to build
   - Help refine requirements through conversation
   - Create issue if needed

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis and Planning

1. **Codebase Analysis Using Serena**

   ```bash
   # Get project overview and understand architecture
   mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview

   # Search for related patterns and existing implementations
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern query:"[relevant-pattern]"

   # Find symbols that might need modification
   mcp__serena__find_symbol name:"[component-name]"
   ```

2. **Requirements Breakdown**
   - Parse acceptance criteria from issue or user input
   - Identify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Define success metrics and validation criteria
   - Document any assumptions or constraints

3. **Implementation Plan Creation**
   - Use TodoWrite to create detailed task breakdown
   - Identify affected files and components
   - Plan API changes (if applicable)
   - Consider backward compatibility
   - Estimate complexity and effort

4. **Architecture Design**
   - Design component interactions
   - Plan data flow and state management
   - Identify integration points
   - Consider performance implications
   - Document security considerations

### Phase 3: Test Specification and Verification

1. **Test Planning**
   - Write comprehensive test specifications for all functionality
   - Include unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests where applicable
   - Define test data requirements
   - Plan negative test cases and edge cases
   - Consider performance and security test scenarios

2. **API Documentation (if applicable)**
   - Update OpenAPI specifications in `src/lib/openapi/registry.ts`
   - Define request/response schemas with Zod
   - Include example requests and responses
   - Document error conditions and status codes
   - Validate OpenAPI coverage with `scripts/validate-openapi-coverage.js`

3. **Test Implementation and Verification**

   ```bash
   # Create test files with complete test specifications
   # For RSS reader project, follow existing patterns:
   # - Unit tests: src/__tests__/unit/
   # - Integration tests: src/__tests__/integration/
   # - E2E tests: src/__tests__/e2e/
   # - Performance tests: src/__tests__/performance/

   # Write failing tests that define the expected behavior
   # Verify tests fail for the right reasons
   npm test -- --testPathPattern="new-feature"
   ```

4. **Test Verification Checkpoint**
   - All test specifications written and validated
   - Tests fail with clear error messages indicating missing implementation
   - Test coverage plan documented
   - API documentation complete (if applicable)
   - No test implementation bugs (tests should fail because feature doesn't exist, not because tests are broken)

### Phase 4: Specification Finalization

1. **Implementation Readiness Review**
   - Verify all requirements are testable
   - Confirm implementation plan is complete
   - Validate that tests define expected behavior clearly
   - Ensure handoff documentation is comprehensive

2. **Documentation and Communication**

   ```bash
   # Update issue with complete specification
   gh issue comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## üìã **Preparation Phase Complete**

```

## Error Handling

- **If GitHub issue not found**: Clear error with suggestion to check issue number
- **If Serena MCP fails to activate**: Fallback to manual code analysis with Read/Grep
- **If test writing fails**: Document the failure and suggest manual test creation
- **If requirements unclear**: Engage user in clarification conversation

## Tool Usage Best Practices

- **Serena MCP**: Primary tool for codebase analysis and symbol navigation
- **GitHub CLI**: Issue management and communication
- **TodoWrite**: Task breakdown and progress tracking
- **Read/Edit**: Test file creation and documentation updates
- **WebSearch**: Research existing patterns and best practices

## Vertical Slicing Benefits

**Complete Value Delivery**: Preparation phase delivers a fully-specified, implementable plan
**Clear Handoff**: Implementation can proceed independently with clear specifications
**Quality Assurance**: Tests are written and verified before implementation begins
**Risk Reduction**: All technical decisions and research completed upfront
**Parallelization**: Multiple features can be prepared while others are being implemented
