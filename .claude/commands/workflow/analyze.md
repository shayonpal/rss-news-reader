# Analyze Linear Issue with Full Context

Analyze the Linear issue provided in $ARGUMENTS with comprehensive project understanding.

This is a `read-only` mode discussion session. No files will be written during analysis.

## 1. Parse Input

Check $ARGUMENTS:

- If starts with "RR-" or just a number ‚Üí Linear issue analysis (continue)
- If Linear URL ‚Üí Extract project/issue ID and continue
- If empty or other text ‚Üí Error: "Please provide a Linear issue ID (e.g., RR-123). Use /capture-idea for new ideas."

## 2. Infrastructure Health Check (MANDATORY)

**Validate testing infrastructure before analysis:**

```bash
# Critical checks - ALL must pass
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint  # Code quality
npx vitest run --no-coverage src/__tests__/unit/rr-176-auto-parse-logic.test.ts  # Test discovery
```

**If ANY check fails:**

- üõë STOP - Use `infra-expert` agent for emergency fixes
- DO NOT proceed on broken foundation

**If all pass:** ‚úÖ Continue to Context Gathering

## 3. Parallel Context Gathering

**Execute ALL of these IN PARALLEL using agents:**

### 3A. Linear Issue Context

Use `linear-expert` to:

- Get full issue with ALL comments and sub-issues
- Check parent/child issues and dependencies
- If the issue has a parent issue, check other children issues of the parent issue to get a better understanding of the larger picture
- Extract description, labels, priority
- Remember: Issue + comments = living specification
- Get context of all other incomplete + Done issues in the current cycle

### 3B. Project Memory Context

Use memory MCP in two steps:

1. **Search for relevant nodes** using `mcp__memory__search_nodes`:
   - Search with query "RSS Reader" OR "RSS News Reader" for project context
   - Also search with keywords from the issue title/description
   - Look for technical terms mentioned in the issue
2. **Open found nodes** using `mcp__memory__open_nodes` to retrieve:
   - Project-specific technical decisions and patterns
   - Stored knowledge about similar features
   - Historical context about architectural choices
   - Any observations related to the current issue topic

### 3C. Recent Work Context

Use `doc-search` and `git-expert` to:

- Check CHANGELOG.md for recently shipped features
- Review last 20 git commits to understand recent changes
- Identify patterns from completed work

### 3D. Database Context

Use `db-expert-readonly` to:

- Get complete database schema and table structures
- Understand existing columns, indexes, and relationships
- Check RLS policies and security advisories
- Identify what data structures already exist

### 3E. Existing Code Context

Use Serena MCP for precise symbolic analysis:

1. **API Endpoint Discovery**:
   - Use `get_symbols_overview` on src/app/api/ to map all route handlers
   - Use `find_symbol` with pattern "GET|POST|PUT|DELETE" for HTTP methods
   - For each endpoint found, use `find_referencing_symbols` to trace usage

2. **Similar Feature Analysis**:
   - Use `find_symbol` with substring_matching=true for related functionality
   - Example: For sync issue, search "sync" to find all sync-related symbols
   - Use depth=1 to understand method signatures without reading full implementations

3. **Dependency Mapping**:
   - For key symbols, use `find_referencing_symbols` to build dependency graph
   - Identify which components, stores, and services will be affected
   - Generate exact modification scope with symbol paths

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Use `search_for_pattern` with semantic awareness for implementation patterns
   - Find similar data flows: store ‚Üí service ‚Üí API ‚Üí database
   - Identify reusable utility functions via symbol relationships

## 4. Update Linear Status

Use `linear-expert` to:

- Move issue to "In Progress"

## 5. Deep Technical Analysis

Based on gathered context, analyze:

### Implementation Requirements:

- Can this use existing API endpoints? (prefer extending over creating new)
- Can this use existing database tables/columns? (prefer extending over new)
- What similar patterns exist in the codebase?
- Use `find_symbol` to locate exact functions/classes to modify
- Use `find_referencing_symbols` to identify ALL code that depends on changes
- Build a complete dependency graph showing ripple effects

### Technical Validation:

- Use `web-researcher` agent to verify feasibility
- Check performance baselines: Will this impact 8-20s test execution?
- For UI features: Plan E2E tests using Playwright

### Code Quality Review:

- Use `code-reviewer` agent to validate proposed approach
- Check for security implications and best practices

## 5A. Symbol-Based Impact Assessment

Execute precise symbol-level analysis:

### Symbol Discovery:

Use Serena to map the feature's symbol footprint:

1. Primary symbols: Classes/functions that implement core logic
2. Secondary symbols: Supporting utilities and helpers
3. Consumer symbols: Components/services that use the feature

### Impact Graph:

Build complete dependency graph:

- Forward dependencies: What this feature will call
- Reverse dependencies: What calls this feature
- Cross-file impacts: Symbols in other files affected

### Modification Precision:

Instead of: "Modify src/lib/stores/article-store.ts"
Provide: "Replace symbol body: ArticleStore/syncArticles (lines 145-203)"
"Insert after symbol: ArticleStore/constructor to add new state"
"17 call sites need updating: [list with symbol paths]"

## 6. Pragmatic Assessment

**Challenge Everything:**

- Does this actually solve the stated problem?
- Is the effort worth the value? (e.g., "3 days for 2% improvement?")
- Are there simpler alternatives?
- Is this even a valid issue that needs solving?
- What could go wrong with this approach?

**Be Direct:**

- "This won't work because..." with clear reasoning
- "Consider X instead because..."
- "This might cause Y issue..."

## 7. Implementation Strategy

Create detailed strategy based on issue type:

### For All Types:

1. List specific files to modify (with line references if applicable)
2. Identify which existing endpoints/functions to extend
3. Database changes needed (if any)
4. Test scenarios to implement
5. Documentation updates required

### Present Strategy:

```
üìã Analysis for RR-XXX: [Title]

üìù Summary:
[2-3 sentences in PM-friendly language]

üîÑ Reusing Existing Code:
- API: [Existing endpoint to extend or "New endpoint required"]
- Database: [Existing tables/columns or "New migration needed"]
- Patterns: [Similar features to follow]

üéØ Implementation Strategy:
1. [Specific file/component - what and why]
2. [Next step with file reference]
3. [Continue with concrete steps]

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:
- [Technical constraint or risk]
- Performance impact on test suite (target: <20s)

üìù Tests Required:
- Unit tests: [scenarios]
- E2E tests: [Playwright scenarios if UI]

üìö Documentation Updates:
- [Files needing updates]

‚ùì Clarifications Needed:
- [Any ambiguities]
```

## 8. Interactive Refinement

Ask:

```
Do you:
1. ‚úÖ Agree with this implementation strategy?
2. üîÑ Want to refine it further?
3. üîç Want a domain expert review?

Please respond with 1, 2, or 3.
```

### If 2 (Refine):

- Ask for specific concerns
- Iterate on strategy
- Return to options

### If 3 (Expert Review):

- Ask which expert (db-expert, devops-expert, ui-expert, test-expert)
- Get expert validation and recommendations
- Incorporate feedback and return to options

### If 1 (Agree):

Continue to step 8

### If no option chosen:

- The user is providing more context and has more doubts
- This is same as choosing 2. They want to continue evolving the strategy.
- Iterate and return to options again
- Continue until the user has provided an option

## 9. Mandatory Documentation

**These steps are REQUIRED - do not skip:**

### 9A. Generate Concrete Test Contracts

Based on the approved strategy, create explicit contracts:

```
üìù Test Contracts for RR-XXX:

API Contracts:
- Endpoint: [exact path]
- Method: [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
- Request Body: [exact JSON structure]
- Success Response: [exact JSON with status code]
- Error Responses:
  - 400: [exact error format]
  - 404: [exact error format]
  - 500: [exact error format]

Database Contracts:
- Table: [table name]
- Operation: [INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE]
- Fields Changed: [field: old_value ‚Üí new_value]
- Constraints: [any constraints that must be checked]

State Transitions:
- Before: [exact database state]
- Action: [what triggers the change]
- After: [exact expected state]
```

### 9B. Update Linear with Strategy and Contracts

Use `linear-expert` to add comment:

```
**Implementation Strategy (Approved)**
[Full strategy details]

**Test Contracts**
[All contracts from 8A]

Timestamp: [current time]
```

### 9C. Gather Symbol-Level Context for test-expert

Use Serena for precise test context:

1. **Symbol Signatures** (via `find_symbol`):
   - Exact function signatures with parameter types
   - Return types and error conditions
   - Class constructors and methods

2. **Test Pattern Discovery** (via `search_for_pattern`):
   - Find test files: pattern "_.test.ts" or "_.spec.ts"
   - Use `get_symbols_overview` on test files to understand test structure
   - Find test utilities: `find_symbol` with "beforeEach|afterEach|describe|it"

3. **Implementation Patterns** (via `find_referencing_symbols`):
   - Trace how similar features are tested
   - Find mock patterns and test helpers
   - Identify integration points needing test coverage

### 9D. Generate Symbol-Aware Test Cases

Provide test-expert with symbol-precise specifications:

```
Symbols to Test:
- Primary: [Exact symbol path with file location]
- Dependencies: [List of dependent symbols from find_referencing_symbols]
- API: [Route handler symbols from get_symbols_overview]

Symbol Contracts:
- Input: [Exact parameters from symbol signature]
- Output: [Return type from symbol analysis]
- Side Effects: [Store updates and service calls traced via references]

Coverage Requirements:
- Unit: Test symbol in isolation with mocked dependencies
- Integration: Test symbol interaction with dependent symbols
- E2E: Test complete flow through symbol call chain
```

IMPORTANT: These tests are the SPECIFICATION. Write them to define exact behavior that implementation must conform to. Tests should NOT be modified later to match implementation.

### 9E. Update Linear with Test Cases

Use `linear-expert` to add comment:

```
**Test Cases (Specification)**
[All test scenarios with exact input/output]

Note: These tests define the specification. Implementation must conform to these tests.
```
