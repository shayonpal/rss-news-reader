# Get top 5 'quick win' tasks

Use the `doc-admin` agent to look into the following documentations:

- README.md (knowledge about what is project is about)
- CHANGELOG.md (for what we have been working on)
- docs/shipped-todos.md (for what we have shipped)
- docs/TODOs.md (for what we have pending)
- docs/product/PRD.md (product specs)
- docs/tech/implementation-strategy.md (implementation details)

Using this info, identify top 5 tasks that could be quick wins for us. In this analysis, don't consider the priorities mentioned within the tasks themselves, use your own understanding.

If you feel the need to refer to any other documentations in docs/ directory, ask `doc-admin`.

This is a `read-only` exercise. We'll start building only after we're done with the planning.
