I want you to go on an investigation journey into my PWA, along with the devops-expert agent. For the past 2 days, Claude Code has been killing my
product and/or dev app all too often. Then it tries to fix it but has been doing a very shoddy job.

- Use doc-admin agent to refer to at least these doc files to get an understanding of context - CHANGELOG.md, README.md,docs/health-check-system.md, docs/tech/implementation-strategy.md, docs/tech/known-issues.md, docs/deployment/caddy-pm2-setup.md, docs/deployment/tailscale-monitoring.md, docs/api/server-endpoints.md
- Also look into past git commits to get an understanding of all the times the servers faced issues and what were done at those times to need to fix it.
- What has really been the issue here? Why are the servers failing this often? try to find a pattern somewhere, if you can.
- This will be a `read-only` exercise.

Once I okay your research, I'd like you to document the full outcome of my investigation, and proposed solutions in a doc file named like `investigation-report-2025-07-26_18-16-10.md`, in the docs/server-instability-issues dir.
