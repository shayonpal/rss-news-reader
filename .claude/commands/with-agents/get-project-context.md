# Get Project Context

Use `docs-expert-readonly` to analyze the following documents:

- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- docs/product/PRD.md
- docs/tech/implementation-strategy.md
- docs/tech/api-integrations.md
- other latest modified files in docs/tech/ directory
- docs/deployment/automatic-sync.md
- docs/deployment/caddy-pm2-setup.md
- Next Session Instructions.md

Use `git-expert` to analyze recent commit history and patterns.

Use `db-expert-readonly` to understand the database schema and structure.

All logs are available at logs/ directory for review.

Once you have gathered this context, provide a comprehensive overview of the project. Stay in `read-only` mode until I agree upon a specific implementation plan.

Note: Use read-only agents where available to gather information without modifying any files.
