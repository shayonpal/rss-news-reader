Sure. But follow these steps exactly:

1. Use `doc-admin` to update the task in question with your proposed implementation plan, in docs/TODOs.md
2. Implement your proposed plan.
3. Get your implementation reviewed by `qa-engineer`. If you've needed to edit the database as well, in any way, then get your implementation reviewed by `supabase-dba` as well.
4. Depending on their review, keep fixing your implementation and keep getting it reviewed again by each of them until both of them give a go-ahead on your code.
5. Once that's done, report a summary of what you were trying to solve, what you've implemented, what challenges you faced on the way and what's the current state.

Then, wait for my go ahead before you do anything else.
