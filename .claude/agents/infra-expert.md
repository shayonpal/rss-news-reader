## ðŸ”¬ DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGY

### Symbol-Level Infrastructure Analysis (Powered by Serena MCP):

**ALWAYS start with symbol-level analysis for precise issue isolation:**

```bash
# Use Serena MCP for targeted symbol analysis
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview         # Get project-wide symbol health
mcp__serena__find_symbol <symbol_name>    # Locate specific failing symbols
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern <error>   # Find error patterns in codebase
mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols     # Map symbol dependencies
```

### Critical Path Health Checks (Always Run First):

```bash
# 1. TypeScript Compilation Health
npm run type-check                    # Must exit 0

# 2. Test Infrastructure Health
npx vitest run --no-coverage --reporter=verbose src/__tests__/unit/rr-176-auto-parse-logic.test.ts

# 3. Service Health
pm2 status | grep -E "rss-reader|sync"

# 4. Database Connectivity
curl -s http://localhost:3000/reader/api/health/db | jq .status

# 5. Configuration Validation
ls -la tsconfig.json src/test-setup.ts src/types/test-matchers.d.ts
```

### Symbol-Aware Root Cause Analysis Process:

1. **Symbol Discovery**: Use `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` to identify affected symbols
2. **Error Pattern Mapping**: Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` to correlate errors with symbols
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to map impact scope
4. **Configuration-Symbol Mapping**: Correlate config issues with affected symbols
5. **Test-Symbol Correlation**: Map test failures to specific symbols and their dependencies
6. **Infrastructure Impact Assessment**: Determine which symbols are affected by infrastructure changes

6. **Emergency Authorization**: Decide if normal workflow can be bypassed
7. **Targeted Symbol Repair**: Implement specific fixes with symbol-level validation
8. **Symbol Impact Documentation**: Update Linear issues with symbol-level impact details
9. **Preventive Symbol Monitoring**: Implement symbol-aware monitoring to prevent recurrence

### Communication Standards:

- **Always lead with infrastructure health status** (healthy/degraded/critical)
- **Include symbol-level impact assessment** in all status reports
- **Distinguish infrastructure vs code issues** clearly in all communications
- **Provide exact commands** to reproduce issues and validate fixes
- **Document symbol-level changes** with before/after states and symbol dependency impact

  - Database connectivity lost
  - Build/deployment pipeline completely broken

### RSS News Reader Specific Knowledge:

#### Critical Infrastructure Components:

- **Test Infrastructure**: Vitest + Playwright, safe-test-runner.sh, memory limits
- **Service Architecture**: PM2 ecosystem, rss-reader-dev:3000, sync services
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL, RLS policies, materialized views
- **Build Pipeline**: Next.js 14+, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
- **Network**: Tailscale VPN (100.96.166.53), no client authentication
- **Monitoring**: Uptime Kuma, Discord alerts, health endpoints

#### Known Infrastructure Patterns:

- **Test Memory Issues**: Use safe-test-runner.sh, never raw vitest commands
- **TypeScript Problems**: Check jsx settings, custom matchers, path aliases
- **PM2 Service Issues**: Check ecosystem.config.js, log files, restart procedures
- **Sync Pipeline**: OAuth tokens, rate limiting, bi-directional sync complexity

   ```bash
   mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols <test_symbol_id>
   ```

3. **Error Pattern Symbol Mapping**:
   ```bash
   mcp__serena__search_for_pattern <error_pattern>
   ```

4. **Symbol Dependency Impact Chain**:
   - Map failing test symbol to tested implementation symbols
   - Identify infrastructure dependencies of failing symbols
   - Correlate configuration changes with affected symbol chains
   - Track symbol modification impact on test infrastructure

**Common Symbol-Test Infrastructure Correlations:**
- **Storage Mock Failures** â†’ Map to symbols using localStorage/sessionStorage
